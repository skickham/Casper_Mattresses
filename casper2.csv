They have two beds setup and encourage you to get comfortable and try out the beds. They had the new wave mattress setup and the casper mattress. 

We've had our mattress for about 30 days now and its been great. I get hot when I sleep, and I was worried the foam would be hot, but it hasn't been an issue at all. My only complaint would be that my old mattress had reinforced sides, so it wouldn't collapse down when you sat on the side of the bed. The casper will collapse on the borders when you sit. Not a big deal for me overall.",8,Sleeps with a partner,1,False,True,False,False,False
1,2018-02-13,J,33.0,Boston, Massachusetts,5,Highly Recommend,"Ive had my previous mattress for YEARS (WAY over the suggested amount of time you should get a new one). Within the last few months, Ive found myself not being able to get into the right position, being uncomfortable throughout the night, more tossing and turning and really starting to feel the springs piercing on my side and back-thats when I knew the time had come for me to get a new mattress. 

The initial reason for me choosing the Casper mattress was time. I dont have the time to be in a mattress store testing a variety of mattress all day. With the Casper mattress theres only two options, the original and the wave, and because I had done my research on the original and found that it fit my needs, I decided to go with it. Luckily, I have a Casper mattress store in my state and was able to test it out one of the displays, pick out my  size mattress (which was in stock), and have it put IN (not strapped to the top) my car! All of this done in less than an hour. Even if I didnt have a store nearby, the hassle free and convenience of having it come in a box is appealing in itself. The unboxing and unwrapping was easy. In the past month, Ive found myself getting better sleep, way less tossing and turning, and hardly no aches and pain in the morning .

My only issue with this mattress is the chemical like smell. My suggestion for that is to let it air out, in another room, for a few days before sleeping on it. Other than that, I am VERY pleased with my purchase. I'll definitely be purchasing the Casper mattress for the remaining beds.",8,Sleeps solo,1,False,False,True,False,False

3,2018-02-13,Jeanne Hamlin,66.0,Brownville, Maine,3,okay,"The un-boxing was interesting.  I was disappointed that the mattress wasn't thicker.  On our support box it is a lot lower than our other mattress was.  The sheets I have do not fit snugly and therefore we sleep on wrinkles in the bottom sheet, which doesn't make for a comfortable surface.  I'm always trying to pull out the wrinkles and re-tuck the bottom fitted sheet.  These are not sheets made for ""deep"" mattresses either.  I wonder if the mattress is made so that only the Casper sheets fit it properly.  It makes me a bit  sad to think that may be the case.  My husband sleeps well on the mattress.  I'm sleeping okay.  I do like that the mattress so far has not developed any saggy spots -- foam usually does that over time, so I'm not sure how long it will stay ""springy"".

The cons: The unboxing definitely  requires two persons !  For an older woman  to pick up and put a 71 pound mattress onto a bed frame was totally exhausting.   If you follow the instructions, you are to put the unrolled mattress on top of the bed before removing the plastic cover.  There is no way I could have picked up the whole mattress. , let alone lift it up onto the bed frame.   So I took the plastic off on the floor, let it pop open, and then little by little got it up on the bed frame.  Why are there no handles on the mattress cover, which would make getting it up on the bed and positioned much easier ??  Yes, there is a strong aroma, so open the windows for 4-5 hours and thats gone.    Be aware, your deep pocket sheets will be way too big for the Casper, which is about 5 inches thinner than the pillow top mattresses.",7,Sleeps solo plus a dog,4,False,False,True,True,False

My time and quality of sleep has remained the same (averaging 6.5 hours).  However, I saved thousands of dollars by purchasing the Casper instead of a new Tempurpedic.  Given that I am a senior person with osteoarthritis almost everywhere (already have had both knees and both shoulders replaced and 3 vertebrae fused in my lower back), I expected my sleep time would not improve greatly with a new mattress (restlessness due to aches and pains in various joints) and my sleep would deteriorate when I bought a new mattress.  The Casper definitely erased that concern.  I also wake significantly less often from being too hot than with my old bed.

The matress began to sag and there was a noticeable crater in the memory foam where I sleep.  It became extremely uncomfortable.

We have to rotate the matress every few weeks.

We covered it from day 1 with a waterproof liner so that if we needed to return it within the 100 day window, we could, and were excited to try it out. In the little pamphlet that comes with the mattress, it says that your body needs some time to adjust being on a good mattress, and in that time you could experience discomfort in your back. 

Even though our backs hurt right from the beginning, we pushed through it and before we knew it we were past the 100 day trial period, but our back still hurt. I think we actually got used to the pain, so much so that we attributed it to the fact that we were getting older and maybe we both just had back problems. That was until we went on a few planned trips and realized that in every other bed we slept in, we woke up with zero back pain. We thought, ""that can't be, let's keep trying our Casper - it got such good reviews, it must be us, not the mattress.""

Flash forward to the holidays, 2017, when we went to Arizona for two weeks. We slept at my parents house, our friend's house (multiple beds), and a hotel. By the time we returned, we were both discussing how wonderful our backs felt, and we were literally dreading getting back into our own bed. We have been home from our trip for one week now, and the pain we are both experiencing is off the charts.

We now know with certainty that it is our Casper mattress that has been negatively affecting our backs. We wake up early in the morning even though we're still tired, because our backs are in such pain. We've tried sleeping on our backs, sides, stomach...nothing helps. 

I'm not sure why this mattress doesn't work for us, and I believe it probably works for some people. I've tried analyzing our bed vs. all these other beds we've slept in to try and figure out what the difference is, but I cannot pinpoint it. At first when you lay down, the Casper seems super firm, which is what we thought we wanted, but actually the longer you lay in it I think the softer it becomes. My guess is it is actually too soft for us. We have our mattress on top of a box spring - I wonder if I put it directly on wooden slats if it would improve, but at this point we are fed up. It shouldn't be this difficult. Our neighbors have a $250 mattress they bought on Amazon that they love - we are probably going to try that next. In the meantime, we have a $950 mattress in pristine condition that I'm not sure what to do with.",8,Sleeps with a partner,31,False,True,False,False,False

During the week before Christmas, I ordered the mattress on Thursday before noon and it arrived on Friday just after lunch.  That was amazing.  I was prepared to wait at least a week during this busy period.

Now for the mattress.  I was worried that because it was foam-based, it might be a tad too soft since I weigh 230 pounds.  It's close to being almost too firm but it's actually perfect.  I had to decide between the Casper and the Canadian (since I'm from Canada) made Endy mattress but the selling point for Casper was the ability to remove the mattress cover using a zipper which I'm almost sure the Endy didn't have by the reviews and photos I've seen, but I could be wrong.  Also, Casper has one more layer of foam and I'd rather have too much than too little.

So my wife and I talked and decided to give it a chance.  After all, with 100 days to try it out there was only a little effort to lose.  So we unpacked the mattress and let it sit open for 24 hours.  I have to say, opening the box and cutting the wrapping off was a cool experience.  We replaced our mattress with the Casper, kept our original box spring.  Night one it was comfortable, firm, cool to the touch, and felt like a hug.  Night two I realized that the edge was not as firm as a standard mattress, but then again it was not hard on the edge.  I realized that I have been sleeping on the edge of my mattress and it was not doing me any favors.  The Casper changed my body alignment in the bed and I am glad it did.  After a week we both agreed it was a good mattress.  After a month we decided to keep it and discarded our original mattress.  It has been over a year now and I would not trade the Casper for anything.  If you paid me a million dollars, I would give you the mattress, but I would buy another one and keep the rest of the money.  I played college football, weigh over 300 pounds, have bad knees, hips, shoulders, and back, but this mattress allows me to get out of bed without any pain.  With my old mattress it would sometimes take me 20 minutes to walk after getting up.  With the Casper I hop out of bed with no pain, it is the best part of my day.  The best part is the Casper still looks brand new, no depressions or sagging at all.  Even the four dogs that fight for position during the day have no effect on the shape if this bed.  Now lets discuss the cooling effect.  I used to sweat every night in my old bed.  The Casper breathes, period.  I do not sweat at night any more.  It is cool in the summer and adjust perfectly to your temp in winter.  I can wear long PJ's and still be comfortable.  And then there is the motion of the mattress.  Ask my wife and she would tell you that I never get up in the middle of the night anymore.  It is not true, but she just does not feel it.  I don't feel her get up in the mornings either.  I never needed an alarm clock until the Casper, she got up first and her moving would wake me up.  Now she gets up and my alarm goes off to wake me up and I think that some days she over slept.  Nope, she just got up without me feeling it.  If you took the time to read this review, then do yourself a favor and try this mattress.  If you don't like it then you are in the vast minority and I have a slightly used mattress to sell you.

I suppose realistically the comfort level is comparable to a brand new high end spring mattress, but I have never liked the idea of sleeping on springs, so I am glad that there are now mattresses available that offer the same or better comfort with less bulk and weight.

419,2017-11-07,C. Young,66.0,Thompson,Thompson,4,Great product! Well designed.,"This product was purchased for the wife after trying 5 different mattress toppers of varied composition & range of firmness. The unboxing was a good experience for all elements of the product. Metal frame & foundation are very easy to assemble for a quick set up - both are well designed. Materials are good / adequate. The Casper itself has a firm feel, making it superior to other designer mattress concepts for anyone with spine injury (old injuries - in this instance) or a lower back that acts up from time to time; I would only recommend a Casper for someone with a back injury for this reason. A mattress like the Casper 'Wave' would probably be the best choice for someone like my son who has multiple spine injuries & disability. He tested it for a half-hour & found it comfortable. He has trouble relaxing & getting to sleep in a reasonable amount of time. 
The Casper is made very well, good materials & quality for the mattress itself. The quality of the sheets & mattress protector are very good. The mattress easily rolled out & regained its shape very quickly. The only reason it gets the 4 instead of the five star rating: Top left corner to lower right corner did not retain the shape completely to the very outer edge of the corner. (Shape - not entirely uniform)
We are very pleased & recommend this product.

I was glad I had some extra help around to bring it in and set it up because it was heavy and awkward for just me. My cats did not like the unboxing experience at all and hid under my roommate's bed for hours, but I thought the vacuum unpacking was fun. It does have that 'new foam bed' smell which adds a chemical overtone to your room for a few days, but it dissipates. What is truly magical about the mattress is the first time you lay down to sleep. Immediately I could feel the mattress contouring to my body and my body responded by releasing tension. First, the big muscle groups in my gluteus, back, and shoulders relaxed. Then, the deeper, smaller muscles gave in. I could feel tiny spasms as the little muscles around my spine and hips released for the first time in about forever. It was quite the sensation as my whole body relaxed. There is definitely an adjustment period as you get used to any new mattress, which was a little over 2 weeks for me. Now, I truly am sleeping deeper, better, and more productively. I wake up with more energy and a whole lot less pain.

I never experienced back pain from a mattress before, and when I visit hotels or a friend's house and sleep on a different mattress, the pain is gone. I am a 5'7"" and 130 pound, 30 yo female with no injuries or health issues and no prior pain. I sleep mostly on my side. 

On the positive side, Casper has excellent customer service and I like the soft feel if the mattress when I first get into bed (the reason for two stars rather than one.) Despite these two positives, it sucks to wake up in pain and I would not recommend the mattress to a friend. 

More information: When I started experiencing pain after the first week, I decided to first wait and see if it got better thinking maybe my body just needed to acclimate. I finally contacted Casper just before my trial ended and told them about the pain. They recommended a firmer support than my box spring and extended my trial another 30 days. It took some time to buy a bed we liked and we were also traveling out of the country for most on the extended trial so we out the bed in our hardwood floor and I felt like it made a difference at first. I even wrote back to the Casper customer service the next day to say so. The additional 30 days passed and although we only slept in the bed for about 10 days of the 30, I still experienced morning pain. We eventually got a bed made of solid hardwood either a sturdy and flat base (as sturdy as the floor) and the pain persists. 

I wish that I had written back to ask for the refund and return when I had the chance. As I mentioned before, there are some positives about the mattress, however no one wants to wake up in pain every morning.

668,2017-10-10,Pat and Bill Evans,70.0,Texas,Texas,4,"At First, It was Love. But Then We Got to Know Each Other a Bit Better.","First off, we are keeping our Casper mattress. This is a well-made product, and Casper does a great job at customer service and marketing. So, why only four stars? 

The foundation we purchased did not fit our 30-year-old wooden bed frame. If the foundation were another half-inch wider and half-inch longer, it would have fit. But it kept falling through. So we returned that and bought an iron-framed, solid-wood set of ""bunky boards."" We placed this contraption over our low-line box springs, and are using the bunky boards (at 3-inch spacing) to support the Casper mattress. We kept the low-line box springs in place for height.

We also put on a high quality mattress pad and 1000-count sheets. It was nice having the sheets fit without a lot of major tugging.

The first month, the Casper seemed absolutely WONDERFUL. But as time went on, the mattress became more firm, and more firm. I am a side sleeper and, over the past few weeks, my arms/hands have gone to sleep from shoulder pressures. I wondered if the very firm Casper was to blame, so I retrieved a 3-inch-thick memory foam topper that we had used with our previously worn bed and plopped that on the Casper.

Now it's love again. My arms/hands are not going to sleep. All Casper needed was my 3-inch-thick memory foam topper.

Would I buy another Casper? Yes...for guest rooms, or if Casper expands its product lines to include a thick memory foam topper. I DO want the firmness of our Casper, but with a way to cushion the firmness.

One more thing: I would like for the Casper to have handles on the sides. Also, when you sit on the side of a Casper mattress, it squishes down, so you kind of slide off. I know that Casper cannot make a mattress that has firm vertical sides, because that wouldn't fit in the small Casper delivery box, and that's part of the Casper surprise. But I do like to sit on the side of a bed without sliding off.

I hope this review helps in Casper's ongoing development of mattresses. I think the company has a wonderful start and will continue to improve and vary its product lines. Let me know when there's an IPO. I'll be investing.",7,Sleeps with a partner,154,False,True,False,False,False

A month or two into our trial, I noticed that my back was tight, and wife was having neck pain.  We traced it back to when we got our Casper.  Sadly, 60 days into our experience, we made the call that it had to go.  In other news, it was a truly no hassle return, not even ""What if we gave you X00$ back?""  The only question was ""When are you available for pickup?"" which was scheduled promptly, it went in the truck, and we are back on the research wagon.

For some context, I was used to sleeping on a traditional box spring roughly 15 years old, with some blankets stuffed underneath to even it out and a 3 inch memory foam topper on top of that. I had been experiencing lower back pain every night, especially in winter when the foam topper froze. (I have minor scoliosis.) My first night I tossed and turned until 2am when I added the foam topper back on. The second night I tried without the topper and was able to sleep better, but it still wasn't cozy enough, so I added another blanket around 3am. The next week I slept the whole night through without thinking about how firm it was. It occasionally still feels firm, like when I sit down on it, or when I wake up and don't feel like snuggling in, because it doesn't feel snuggly. I've had the mattress for almost three weeks now, and even already I don't mind staying in bed when I wake up, and don't feel like it's firm.  It definitely took at least a week to adjust and forget the ""ghost"" of what my bed was supposed to feel like, and continues to feel more comfortable each week. My back pain is practically gone and doesn't bother me anymore. I've been having great nights of sleep, even up to 3 hours without being ""restless"" according to my fitbit, which is rare for me. I don't feel overheated after adding more blankets, and I sure appreciate how quiet the mattress is compared to my old one - I no longer worry my downstairs neighbor can hear me rolling over all night.

However, beginning in July, I noticed that the side that I use to enter the bed and sleep upon was becoming saggy and a noticeable depression in the mattress was developing..  I turned the mattress around so that I could use the other side.  Sure enough, by the end of August, a depression was forming in that side as well.

We lay on it for a bit at West Elm before placing the order and it felt great in the store.

Taking it home was interesting; it barely fit into the back of a standard sedan; we had to remove the plastic-wrapped roll from the box and roll down the window. Unboxing it was neat but we had to let it air out for a few days in the living room. It definitely had some fumes (but the fumes from the mattress protector were way worse). Warning: Moving it into the bedroom was all kinds of awkward since the mattress is floppy and extremely heavy.

We have different experiences sleeping on it. Our old Serta BeautyRest gave my boyfriend lower back pain and he now wakes up refreshed and pain-free every morning. It's been nearly a year and he's had zero complaints. I, on the other hand, have had a stiff back for as long as we've had the mattress. I tried talking to customer service about it after about 6 weeks of sleeping on it, and they insisted that I continue trying it out. Before I even realized it, 100 days had passed, and we're stuck with the mattress. I feel like I'm comfortable on the mattress (both on my back and my side), but I still wake up stiff and sore every morning and spend the entire day much more tired than I used to be, which leads me to believe that my quality of sleep has gone down.

Our old mattress was a firm coil spring version, so, this is a change.  The Casper mattress is easy to sleep on and comfortable.  It is, however, not as firm a mattress as we would like.

745,2017-09-11,Jeffrey,39.0,New York, New York,5,Awesome Mattress & Phenomenal Customer Service,"We just replaced our old Tempurpedic mattress to accommodate 2 adults and our 2 toddlers, who always manage to end up in our bed  -I am 6'0"" and 170-lbs. and my wife is 5'7"" and 115-lbs, and both kids are a combined 65-lbs. The Casper mattress is more ""responsive"" than our old mattress ... the material absorbs us quicker, but rebounds faster. My wife thinks it's softer because of this faster response. Our old mattress enveloped us slowly, but I agree it was also firmer once we settled into our sleeping positions. The ""faster"" response of the Casper mattress did not however translate into more motion transfer when we moved about at night, and with the kids jumping into bed. As an added experiment, I had both kids jump up & down (as they usually do) while both me and my wife laid on the bed ... we felt no meaningful difference between it and our old mattress. 

The MOST obvious difference to the both of us was the temperature. The Casper felt noticeably cooler, and I know Tempurpedic has new ""Breeze"" mattresses, which was the object of our original purchase decision (before deciding to try Casper). The bed feels cool and even as sleep progresses, I did not sense any accumulated warmth build-up around my body. We weren't cold in sleep, but a noticeable difference from our old mattress. While I have no evidence of it, I believe this dissipation of heat during sleep has resulted in more REM sleep. I feel generally more refreshed in the morning, although my wife did say she felt like she needed to cover up more frequently as her body temperature dropped at night.

I would really like to understand the price difference of nearly $5,000USD between the Casper and a new Tempurpedic Breeze mattress of the same size. I cannot for the life of me understand the difference by sleeping on the two different brands, nor could I find a distinction in materials online. They both appear to be equally well constructed and employ similar materials. They carry the same warranty. It appears that the price difference is solely related to brand, history, and distribution channel. The 120-lb. package that came was easily unpacked and unfurled on our bed, so I see very little benefit to the traditional mattress store shopping experience. The only unknown I suppose is the longevity, which our Tempurpedic lasted more than a decade and even when we got rid of it (can't sell or donate in Manhattan), it was a solid mattress.

I'll start with the good: delivery/unboxing were easy, and I sleep well on the mattress. I feel well-supported and my back doesn't get sore. 

The cons: my mattress doesn't seem to be quite ""perfect."" The corners at the foot of the bed didn't expand the way they should have, so they sort of lift up. It doesn't bother my sleep, but it's not aesthetically the best. There's also a weird divot on the side of the mattress that didn't expand. It's like a hard indentation about three inches across, along the seam. Weird. Both of these problems don't actually affect the mattress's function and aren't major enough to go through the hassle of a replacement, but it annoys me that I paid so much for an imperfect product. 

On another note, I also got Casper's boxspring and frame. The frame is fine, and was easy to assemble. The boxspring is another matter. The assembly would have been super easy, and I was thrilled with it until it was time to slide in the support beam. Basically, my beam was improperly sized. It can't slide in all the way so it sits too high on one end, which means the slatted beams can't lay flat on top of it, so the foot of the bed is now uneven.

It definitely feels comfortable, but I don't sleep well on it. I reached out to Casper within the return period, and rather than processing the return, they instead encouraged me to consider a topper (for an additional $20). I don't know why I agreed... The topper helped and my trial period lapsed. Now, two years in, I'm back to sleeping poorly, and worse, I wake up with shoulder pain and numbness.  I'm assuming the topper has reached end of life, but I'm not going to keep throwing money at this. I expect a mattress to last 10 years, not 2.

Casper has responded to my latest inquiry, but the only advice I'm getting is about purchasing a new 3rd party topper, investigating my bed frame, or changing my pillow. These are not the problem, I've been trying everything possible to avoid having to buy a new mattress. The fact is, Casper is not for everyone, particularly side-sleepers. Instead of encouraging me to purchase a topper, Casper should have simply agreed to the return when I first contacted them. What's most upsetting is finding out that the topper program was a pilot which has been discontinued. Bad timing on my part I. guess.

I do feel a bit conned, so word to the wise: this mattress may be great for many, but no mattress is perfect for everyone.

After moving in with the boyfriend and having multiple things go wrong, we were not excited to hear that the Casper delivery we planned 2 weeks in advance was going to be late and we'd be sleeping on the floor. Calling customer service on my birthday wasn't fun either. After multiple attempts to get the mattress to us, and a few frustrated emails to customer service, we wound up picking up the mattress from a close UPS location. We weren't happy about having to go pick it up and break our backs (seriously, it's really heavy), however once we got it, we were the happiest campers.

Customer service made it so much better by checking in to make sure everything went alright (after already offering $ off for the late delivery). THEN, and totally unexpected, they remembered I called in on my birthday and sent a Harry and David's breakfast gift set. I was flabbergasted and so surprised. 

Finally woke up and made the breakfast set, btw. Yum! ;)

We didn't replace our old mattress because we were sleeping poorly or because we had any specific complaints with the old mattress, We just thought since the average mattress should be replaced every 5-10 years maybe after 16 years the time had come for a new one. We've now had our Casper foam mattress for just over 30 days and we like it.  We are not sleeping any better or any worse than on our old mattress, which I know is not exactly the ringing endorsement the good folks at Casper want to hear.  However, maybe we owned the world's best spring mattress and didn't know it? We certainly will keep the Casper, I just can't give a raving review of how much better life is sleeping on it.

It did cost me my arm and shoulder bones having to be replaced with cadaver bones along with screws and plates being implanted. Also had a compression fraction on my l1 in my back. Bear with me this is leading somewhere. So once I got out of the hospital in February I was eager to get home into my comfort zone. But the first time I attempted to sleep in my standard memory foam mattress, I knew something was terribly wrong. I woke up 2 hours into the night because my spine was bending right at the fracture point while laying on my side. The only place I've been able to sleep is on the couch for the last 6 months. So about 2 months ago I decided I had to do something. So I went out and bought a sleep number bed for 3k. Big mistake. Just know that even if you buy one and decide its not for you it will still cost you 800 dollars in delivery and pickup charges.... what a joke right? So after experimenting with it and deciding it wasn't my cup of tea, back on the couch I went. Then a friend informed me of the Casper mattress. So I jump on the internet to do by due diligence and after debating for a couple weeks I decided to pull the trigger as my couch has gotten lopsided from me sleeping on it everyday. I received my mattress in 4 business days, not bad at all. Set up was a snap as I was expecting the usual wait time you have with memory foams ( letting the breathe). I just cut the plastic and it came to life! So here we go time for the test........I slept like a baby!!! It was a little firmer than what I was expecting but oddly there's zero pressure points. My spine is no longer bending! After 4 nights on the miracle mattress I'm in love! Easily the best purchase i've made in my life! I slept so well last night that I didn't move once. I know this because I woke up with my arm stretched under my pillow and it was cramping because I hadn't moved it! If you have any spinal problems or general back issues roll the dice pull the trigger and change your life. I almost feel normal again. You really have nothing to lose as this comes with a 100 night trial. Just a heads up from a firm believer. People usually only write a review if theres a problem. Quite the opposite here.

I liked it a lot right away, but after about a week and a half, my husband decided it was a touch too firm for him and didn't contour to his lower back as much as he would like. I called Casper, and they suggested a Lucid gel foam mattress topper. We ordered the Lucid 3"" Gel Memory Foam Topper from Amazon for $94 I believe.  I liked the Casper alone, but LOVE it with the topper. If you like support but still like that feeling of sinking in and contouring to your body, I would highly recommend this combo.

You wouldn't believe it but I don't have the unbearably pain anymore. I literally can't believe it. I'm so use to feeling the pain that now that I don't it's ackward.

The sheets and protector are made of the best fabric and are designed to fit the bed perfectly and my pillow was so comfortable all my neck cricks and back aches went away. I was amazed how much difference a good pillow makes in ones body alignment. We are very happy with our Casper and are very glad we purchased it.

However, to be fair, I waited almost a year to review (mid-July= 1 yr).... After another bad night sleep, I just had to write a review today, which I never do:
I can confidently say that I have NOT HAD ONE good nights sleep on this mattress, toss & turn all night trying to get a good position without pressure points, which is IMPOSSIBLE FOR A SIDE SLEEPER ON THIS MATTRESS. (I am a petite female at appropriate weight & BMI). I find myself wishing for my next hotel stay to get a good nights sleep and  I do sleep very well on more comfortable mattresses!

If it's not right out of the box after 1-2 weeks ..return it!!!  It's not going to get any better!

This was a horrible purchase for me, deeply regret buying this mattress! I will admit that I got impressed with all the positive press and hype around this company initially, but in the end, all that meant nothing! ...didn't add to better product/sleep quality, as far as I am concerned and isn't that what this company is selling...belter sleep?   In retrospect, I was better off with my failing old mattress...Waste of hard earned money...which I recognize was my fault and should have returned it before the end of my trial...Don't make the same foolish mistakes I did!

I was afraid I'd find it too ""hard"" due to others' reviews, but haven't found that to be the case. I don't know if other people waking up with neck and back pains may be due to how they adjust to a new mattress? I was sleeping on a 31-year-old mattress before this and sometimes slept great, other times not well... it was due to however stressed out I was at the time. Just a thought.

Some thoughts:

Try it out in person first if you can.
Casper mattresses are now available at West Elm stores, which was a huge help for me, since I tried the Tuft and Needle mattress first (I live in San Francisco, so was able to go to the showroom) and found their surface a little too ""squishy"". The T&N mattress is made up of a thick base layer and then the squishy layer on top, whereas the Casper mattress is a base layer topped with three more layers (it looks like a Neapolitan ice cream sandwich from the side, haha). For me the Casper structure is the right amount of support and squish.

Mattress protector
Adds another layer of firmness/structure (not a lot, just a bit) but unfortunately makes it run hotter, since it's waterproof. I keep waking up with a sweaty hot spot between my shoulder blades. Not sure if I'm going to keep this which is a bummer because I'd rather have the protection.

Air it out first.
I had the mattress and foundation delivered, then slept on it right away, and two weeks later I''m finally airing it out because waking up smelling like mattress is too much. After six hours with the bedroom window wide open, the smell is mostly gone, but it looks like it's going to take at least a few more days to get rid of it.

Softness and support
I'm finding I like this the most with the cover off, which is a bummer since it needs a cover...! I wouldn't say my own neck and back pains magically went away after the first night, but now without the cover (am sitting/lying on it while airing it out), they have/it's 'perfect.'

If you are of average size or like a soft bed, I am certain it would be a great mattress for you.  However, I am a larger man (240 lbs.).  It felt like I had done a hard total body workout for the entire first week.  I was sunken way down into the mattress.  I thought I would adjust to it because I travel extensively for work, I am not in the bed at home much over half of the time.  By the end of the first month I was relishing being on the road for the good sleep I would get on the much firmer hotel beds.  I did get use to the being sunken in and surrounded.  By far my biggest issue was that my hips would sink in much lower than the rest of my body.  I would wake up with back and neck problems because of how the mattress was not firm enough.  My wife had started to get decent sleep on it.  She has multiple pain issues fibromyalgia, arthritis, etc.  She liked the softer bed.  We ended up moving back to a conventional firm plush and she has a soft bed topper on her side.

After 2 weeks we both hated it and it went back.  Someone mentioned that we should try a Casper Mattress.  He went on-line, read the reviews and convinced me to try it.  Best decision ever.  We are very happy with it.  Since I like a firm and he likes less firm, it is the perfect compromise for us.  The entire process from ordering it to taking it out of the box and putting it on the bed went smoothly. Our bedroom is on the second floor and I was able to bring the box upstairs myself.  I followed the directions included with the mattress and opened it on the bed. We use our mattress on a solid surface base which is on top of a box spring in a traditional bedframe with a headboard and footboard.  (we use the box spring just to give the bed some height)

Hopefully this is a honest and helpful review for those who are considering this mattress.

The mattress definitely performs as advertised and the quality of the experience is proved by laying in the mattress. The aethetics of the casper mattress gives a nice welcoming and the body hugging softness was a very nice experience. However, personally I found the mattress too soft for my weight and sleeping habits. Sleeping for short sessions was comfortable but long sleeps became unpleasant. Also, for a person who likes to sleep on the edge of the mattress this was not for me. There are definetly people who will love and be capatible with thos mattress, unfortunately I need some more support. 

Sleeping habits: 
Mostly side sleeper
Turns a lot
Likes cooling mattresses
Needs stronger back support
Sleeps on the edges 

Finally delivery was smooth and fast. It arrived within a week or two. The casper team did a good job but my local delivery company that casper chose was a bit more inconvenient in their delivery methods. In order not to miss delivery you need to wait home for the entire day which I cannot afford to do.

Overall the experience was good. I would recommend people who like soft, warm and body hugging sleeps to give this mattress a try. :)",6,Sleeps solo,237,False,False,True,False,False

The mattress is fine during the winter but with the warmer days I've been tossing and turning - this mattress doesn't breathe. I notice this last summer but thought I just need to adjust. But I was reminded of the issue now that the warmer days are upon as once again - I'm not sleeping yet again, keep waking up all the time, and it's only spring! Other than that it's just a cheap foam mattress - I see that you can get similar product in IKEA for example for half or even third of a price AND 365 day testing period AND 25 years warranty. If it was for branding and marketing strategy only this mattress would get flying colors. The 'unboxing' is its least important thing when it comes to mattress though. It just shows you that it's made of foam, which will start to crumble soon, unlike coil mattress. I ended up buying a coil mattress with natural wool instead of fire retardants, a little bit if natural perforated foam (Casper is not perforated, therefore no air will pass through) - twice the price but ten times the quality (and no, it wasn't from IKEA)..

Was in a bad accident sleeping on my mattress was a no go for me now. I was in a bad motorcycle accident 3 yrs ago, my wife slept in the room i slept on the couch. Finally decided to try the Casper Mattress after no luck in the stores. The First night was great ( was expected thoe, anything you do for the first time always seems to be better) after that sleep it went down hill from there, I kept telling my wife we gotta allow our body to adjust to it. Almost 3 months later still didnt work for me. 

The pros, easy setup, the foundation takes mins to put together, roll the slats on lift the heavy casper on it and done! No flip. 

The Cons, Low profile to the ground, getting up was difficult from a low profile.
-being formed to the mattress and trying to roll over in bed to cuddle was difficult without hurting my back (I  had to very careful not hurt to myself). Because of the foam it is hotter then a spring mattress but something some may adopt to for a good sleep. 

I tried using my old box springs under the casper that made getting out the bed easier ( after the struggle to roll over) but made it easier being higher up. 

My final thoughts, What works for me may not for you, with that being said, you really dont have much to loose other then the price of the mattress protector ( but every big store has this policy ) plus the cost of it is steep but better then be stock with something that doesnt work right.  Give it a try, give it at least 2 30-90 days to allow your body to adopt to it, if it doesnt work out they come and pickit for me. I really like the foundation construction, 6"" in more in height would be way better plus would allow for a different design ( drawers would be great).

At first it didn't seem to be any better than our old crappy memory foam mattress. What I learned in dealing with Casper customer service was that I might wanna try getting a new foundation/box spring. Since I'd already passed the 100-night trial I really had no choice. You can buy the Casper foundation if you wanna shell out another $250 or so, which I didn't. Fiona, the super nice CSA, who didn't really have to give me the time of day since I was kinda stuck with it, suggested a bunkie board or a piece of plywood. We got a bunkie board for $75 at Original Mattress Factory and, yes, it made all the difference.  Our old foundation was not equipped for the heavy weight of memory foam. It wasn't that old, it just wasn't the right thing to use. Wish I'd known this when I bought and returned the Purple mattress I'd bought first. I think a new foundation would have made it the right one--it wasn't nearly as hard as Casper. Purple was like a dream mattress to me and i was so sad to return it but it was killing our backs.

When I took mine out of the plastic bag I did note a very minor odor that was not offensive for just a few minutes.

I used to have back pain with our old mattress (even with a memory foam topper). With the Casper, I've found that I no longer have back pain when I wake up and sleep more soundly.

While I would recommend this mattress to a friend, I think it's worth remembering that they seem to have designed it to be more firm. If you need something softer, consider adding a topper.

I also think there's something to be said for what you put under the Casper. We have both a box spring and a soft wood frame, which seems to provide more give.

I then laid down and discovered with my body spread around that it was very, very firm (for me). I tried sleeping on it for two knights and couldn't stand it, it was just too firm. Now comes the fine tuning, I put on a solid (non egg crate) 2"" thick memory foam topper with a firmness rating of 5.3 and for me the mattress is now absolutely perfect. Soft yet firm support.

We are not experts, but guess it is the firmness. My wife does feel the temperature of the mattress is an improvement, so that's a positive. If it would be a bit softer it would more than likely be perfect.
Not jumping to any hasty conclusions or decisions yet since Casper offers the great 100 day love or return offer, so we agreed we would hang in there a few more weeks at least. Friends and family told us to give it at least two weeks. I almost want to throw a cooling softer topper on it, but we'll see.

Capser would not honor the referral because I chose a 6 month financing option offered. Seems to me it would not matter as they were getting their money upfront from the finance company.

I ordered white glove service, because I would not be home for the box delivery, so that cost me extra, but was able to get a short window for delivery.  I was charged for mattress removal AND a mattress recycling fee.  

The bed was a disappointment.  You can not sit on the edge of the bed to put on your shoes on as there is absolutely NO support on the edge. During the first month, the bed expanded past the posted dimensions on the web site and no longer fit within platform bed..  

The return process was very easy but left a very bad taste in my mouth.  Casper advertises that they have an arrangement with non profits to donate returned beds.  When 1-800- Junk showed up, I casually asked where they were taking the bed, and there response was the dump. I inquired- don't you donate the bed to a non profit?  There response is no we take it to the dump.  Which led me to my next questions, ""how many Casper returns to do pick up weekly"", response : ""a chuckle"" then: ""this is our third in a week"". 

To be fair, they also said they picked up other mail order beds on a frequent basis.  

The two things that really bother me the most of this entire process 1) Not honoring $50.00 referral from my ex. seems like a bait and switch  2) Misleading customers about donating returned beds to local non profits.

1302,2017-03-01,Chris Shipp,51.0,Albany, Louisiana,5,Best sleep ever,"There are several issues that I have found with mattresses that my Casper mattress fully addresses.  First, many mattresses that claim to be comfortable are simply too soft.  In these cases, ""comfort"" equals inadequate support that leads to back and joint pain. My Casper mattress has just the right level of firmness to provide the proper amount of support.  As an older person with significant arthritis, I'm qualified to say that the Casper mattress provides the perfect amount of support for those with arthritis-related joint pain.  My hips and shoulders haven't felt this good after a night's sleep in years. Second, the materials that are used in some mattresses cause them to be hot.  The Casper mattress actually feels cool all of the time.  Yes, I know this sounds ridiculous but it has been my consistent experience.  Finally, I find it difficult to roll around or move in many mattresses because I sink into them too deeply.  Not so with the Casper.  Rolling and general movement are easy with the Casper mattress.  Look, I'm a busy person.  I don't generally spend my time writing product reviews.  But the Casper mattress has truly changed my life for the better.

Seriously. The morning stiffness in my neck and back is also gone and that is huge.  My very first impression after arrival was that it was too firm -- my previous bed had a pillow top so I was used to a softer top surface (boyfriend hated the pillow top and LOVES the Casper, btw). It totally contours to your body perfectly.  The only issue I had was scheduling the delivery.  Because of my work, I was unable to take a day to wait for the bed and the Saturday delivery just did not happen thanks to UPS, not Casper.  I tried to work with UPS and informed them I would pick it up at their holding location on the following Saturday but when I got there, they had already returned it.  Casper's customer service was awesome.  When I explained that I had been sleeping on a couch for a week, waiting for the bed.  The person I spoke with (wish I remembered his name) informed me that NYC has a white glove service and that he would have them deliver it that very day.

The only thing I would add is this: if you return the Casper, be adamant about it being picked up by a non-profit in your area. I work for a non-profit and a large part of the reason I was willing to give Casper a try was because the website said it would be donated to a charity if it was returned. But if I had not spoken up and basically demanded that my mattress go to a charity and not a landfill, I'm not confident that it would have, because it was originally scheduled to be picked up by a non-charity.

Importantly, it is good for sleeping 2 people (every movement doesn't shake the whole bed, the heavier person doesn't make a cave for the lighter person to fall into). 

My issue was with the delivery service. On the day my mattress was due to arrive I skipped class to stay home for the delivery, as a lot of mail theft happens in my area. (To be clear, I selected the delivery option where they did not require me to sign, as I do not have a car and picking up from post office would be very difficult if I couldn't be at home for any reason). I waited all day, and no one came to the door. When I finally decided the delivery wasn't going to happen and left the house, I found the mattress not at my door, but at the bottom of the outdoor stairwell on the other side of my building (btw there is no security in my building and the front door of my apartment is accessible to public). The delivery person had not bothered to even knock on my door, and who knows how long the mattress had been there, out in the open for anyone to take, On top of that, the package was extremely heavy and I could not carry it up the stairs by myself. I had to stay there with it until my roommate came home and helped me. Receiving this mattress took up my entire day. I chose Casper for the delivery service. I expected that an effort would be made to keep the package safe even if I had opted not to sign for it, but they just dumped it at the front of the building and moved on. I also expected that an attempt would be made to deliver right to my door, especially considering how heavy the package was. I was very disappointed. This was a very expensive purchase for me and I'm sad the service was so poor.

I was in the market for a new bed since mine was close to 15 years old. I've had spring mattresses all my life so I didn't know any different. I didn't have any back problems, just could feel the springs when I slept. But I did my research and found the memory foam had the best reviews compared to all mattress types and upon doing more research, concluded the Casper was the one  for me. I looked at the Leesa and Purple, and other competitors but all of those reviews said they were way too fim. Casper had been in the market longer and changed their mattress throughout that time based on their customer's reviews and suggestions. I was still nervous the Casper would be firm but based on reviews, it is that perfect combo of both. And they were right! I still don't consider it firm, it is a very cloud-like feeling when you lay down. It conforms around your body and is very supportive, not that memory foam, hard as a rock feel. Maybe when you sit up on it initially it feels firmer but not in that hard as a rock way.  More like Support under your body weight type of feel that is comfortable. That is something I wish more people elaborated on, so I hope this helps someone wanting to know about the firm/soft thing! I would rate 5-6/10 on firmness. I have found It does get a tad hot. It does hold your body heat but nothing a fan and less blankets could solve.

We gave it the recommended time to air out and probably had an above average ventilation system going. We had several windows open, a ceiling fan and 2 floor fans on the mattress. We let it air out for the first 24 hours before sleeping on it. After that, we removed the sheets every morning to continue to let it air out... To no avail. Finally after an entire week passed I decided I couldn't sleep with the nauseating smell so we bought a heavy duty mattress protector and doubled up on sheets. The bed itself is very comfortable and my fianc loves it. He sleeps like a rock. I have back problems and although this is much more comfortable than our last mattress, it did not solve all my sleeping issues and I'm still waking up with aches. If you don't have back issues, this is likely going to be the best choice you've ever made.

My previous bed was more than $4,000.00, and stood about 45"" tall with the 18"" mattress, box spring, and frame; the Casper bed+foundation+frame is about 24"" off the floor, so a huge difference within the room;  however, It is far easier for our aging pup to get up onto the bed.  The foundation system was so utterly simple... warning though... you do not need to take apart existing frame/headboard first, the Casper foundation fits right into the existing frame, silly me!

I have not slept that way in years. Each night the mattress has become more comfortable and I am pleased with it. I use an adjustable base and it works very well with the mattress.

I am a side sleeper, weigh 142 pounds.  Sam, Yorkie Extraordinaire (just ask him!) weighs about 6.5 pounds. He's my bed buddy. The main reason why I chose Casper was the rating from Consumer Reports, which I depend on for any major purchase. I, too, was surprised at how firm it was--the first night. After that, I just fall on the bed at night and sleep (I'm still in the process of moving to a new home and I'm exhausted!). The second night my poor arthritic body was in so much pain from lifting too-heavy boxes I couldn't even straighten up. When I woke up the next day, I was refreshed and the pain was gone.  So, my experience was and continues to be very positive.  Sorry, all you who are disappointed with your Casper.

Casper felt just a bit odd the first night.  Probably because there's no bounce.

I guess, from a Yorkie standpoint, you can never have too much energy.

We relied mostly on Casper reviews and Consumer Reports ratings. We previously owned an older Tempurpedic firm mattress and as we have aged we needed to add a 3"" topper to soften the feel and eliminate our hands or arms going to sleep. Most recently at our second home we had an older Beauty Rest hybrid with a 3"" topper which was more forgiving than the Tempurpedic, but it was time to replace it. To add to our confusion we also, within the last year, purchased a Sleep Number R5 bed for our RV which we quite like. Our concern was getting a mattress with great support, less than 14"" thick, and soft enough to eliminate our aging issues. We looked at several Tempurpedics and Serta models and all seemed too firm and you know where the prices are. The Sleep Number P5 mattress was a good alternative and was identical to our RV Sleep Number model, but we have liked the feel, support and  sleeping on foam mattress in years past.  We toyed between ordering the Costco foam Mattress recommended by Consumer Reports, not the store stocked model, which was 14"" thick or trying the Casper first. If we liked it we saved some money. If not we could return it and try a different manufacturer. Bottom line it took us less than a week to adjust to the Casper and we're keeping it.

It has now been almost a month and our body aches are gone.  We sleep about 7-8 hours per night and if one gets up during the night the other doesn't even know it (and I am a very light sleeper).

It is the best sleep we have ever had. The unpacking experience was great. We are senior citizens and don't have the strength and agility we used to have. It was such a relief that the unpacking and set up of the mattress was easy and completely within our physical capabilities. Such a relief that we didn't have to call our son to have him come over to help us. The bedding we also ordered was beautiful and enhanced the sleep process. No more waking up from being overheated, we stay cool and comfortable all night long. We also ordered Casper dog beds for our two senior dogs. When the beds arrived we unpacked them and the dogs immediately realized they were for them. They love the beds and their arthritis seems to be better.

It's like basing your marriage just on your wedding day! It's not about the unboxing process, who cares about that! It's about how the mattress performs for life! That also applies to the ""one mattress fits all"" mentality here. I was a bit skeptical about that and it turns out to be true. There is no way one mattress can be designed for everyone. I find it not supportive enough, but at the same time, too firm for me. I also agree with other comments about sliding off of the mattress when sitting on the edge. It's ridiculous! The sides of the mattress should be supported so that you can sit on it comfortably and there should be at least 3 different firm/soft options to fit your individual taste.

They were sleeping on an older mattress that was very uncomfortable and actually causing them additional pain due to springs, sags, etc.
I was skeptical at first, but felt we had nothing to lose in trying your product.
From the moment I visited your website, I was impressed and my fears somewhat relieved.
The purchase process was simple, the product information was relevant and honest, and the free financing made the difference between purchasing and not purchasing your mattress.
The only obstacle to overcome was: would this product actually live up to it's promises and would it help my parents get a better, more healthful nights sleep? When the product came, delivered to my door, we had it in place on top of their existing base within the first hour. After the first night's sleep, I cautiously asked their opinion and was thrilled to hear they absolutely loved this new mattress. Over the next few weeks I continued to monitor their sleep habits which continually seemed to improve. They are sleeping deeper and longer, and waking with far less aches and pains than with the previous conventional mattress. My father jokes that they never want to get out of bed anymore as this feels like their own little cocoon when they are all wrapped up in warm blankets on this cozy mattress.
Since then, all my concerns have been eliminated and I am very thankful I chose to make this small investment for them, and am very grateful to your company for this product. 
Now, when my monthly finance payment comes due, I gladly pay it, knowing what a difference this mattress has made in the lives of my parents; no buyer's remorse, here!

We had been sleeping on a 8 year old innerspring that was pretty much dead. At the time I was about 5 months pregnant, and feeling uncomfortable. It took a few nights to get used to, but my husband and I were quickly sold on the Casper mattress. We wound up buying pillows right away, and referred a friend who bought a mattress and is also so happy with it.

I am now 9 months pregnant, and I sleep great every night. I am totally convinced it is due to the mattress. I have a pregnancy pillow that I don't use, because the Casper supports my body in a way that doesn't ever put pressure on the baby or my joints. My friends and family with babies cannot believe I am this far along and am comfortable sleeping on just a mattress.

There are so many weird gadgets out there geared towards easing pregnancy, but a fantastic mattress really is a lifesaver. Somehow the foam supports a heavy pregnant body in a way that a spring coil mattress
does not. 

All I know is that it feels great, every night.

For reference, my husband and I are average-sized people, and sleep with a 28 lbs Scottish Terrier on a queen-sized mattress. My husband gets up much earlier than I do, and I don't even feel him getting out of bed.

It is a little softer than I prefer and I don't like how there's no support on the sides so I sink down to the platform when I sit on the side.  However I would be OK with those issues if not for one thing... The mattress is too thin!  Years ago all the manufacturers switch to super thick mattresses with pillow tops that made the mattress extra deep.  Then all the sheet manufacturers had to catch up and make deep pocket sheets.  Now these new mattresses (Casper is not alone in this) made of foam/latex rather than traditional springs are back to the older thinner size.  None of my sheets fit properly!  I like my sheets to fit tightly so they are as smooth as possible and don't bunch up under me while I sleep.  I'm afraid that's exactly what happens now on the Casper.  I could buy a mattress topper to increase the thickness but 1, it's not necessary and 2, why should I pay more to make it thicker?!?  I'm still considering whether I'll keep the Casper or send it back because of this.  It seems you could put an inexpensive extra layer on the bottom just to solve this issue.

So I used those resources to determine the quality of the product.  I say this because I did a ton of research on all of the competing ""memory foam"" mattresses.  As an engineer I had to understand all of the goods and bads because there is a significant difference between these types of mattresses and standard spring mattresses.

With all that said, this is by far the best mattress for the dollar.  In the simplest terms, the high end competitors mattress is 5x the cost of the Casper mattress.  There is not enough difference in the foams to make it last 5x as long.  So they aren't worth the premium cost.  The quality of the Casper mattress is outstanding.  The materials used and the engineering that went into each layer are top shelf.

Packaging is awesome, and shipping is fast.  Just a great all around experience.  I highly recommend it.

Now I will say it took me close to a month to adjust to the mattress.  I have always had a spring mattress, so my sleep posture was used to it.  It took my body a while to adjust to the proper support the Casper mattress gave me.  After that period, I have slept like a baby.  Just an outstanding product.

I had heard about Casper from a family discussion aon the cool experience in which you could try it out for 90 days and nobody was returning them apparently they were so comfortable.

I honestly wasn't sure if Casper would work out with my shoulder injury and pain as I had never tried anything memory foam-related before. But since people seemed to be raving about its comfort and there was a free trial I decided to give it a go.

I'm a pilot, so I after spending a lot of time in the air, I like to sleep on a bed that creates a feeling of stability, tenderness but also firmness. The Casper was all that. I love the bed so much. I've had the mattress for several months and it is heaven. Whenever I crawl in and lie down I am immediately struck by the sweet simple comfort: tender on the top but with a firm very stable base. Even when my BF stays over I never feel his weight or presence on the other side nor does it disturb my side, and he weighs a lot more than me.

Not only is it a high quality product but the customer service is remarkable, In an era where companies do everything they can to avoid providing customer service and try to bamboozle you at every turn, Casper is making its mark with respectful, generous and helpful customer service at every step.

I was having issues with the delivery of my bed, Purolator in Montreal were being really unhelpful and rude, when my mom suggested I contact Casper in case they could do something. Well they instantly took care of it. They shipped me a second mattress from the USA to see which mattress would get to me first, and they gave me 50$ discount for my troubles, which I did NOT ask for. I couldn't believe it. I didn't have to beg, cry or get angry, the moment I told them the problem they were happily resolving it.

With 2 people I'm sure the setup would go much smoother.  As it turns out, I was flying solo for my project.  I setup the Hollywood bed frame I purchased separately,  I put together the base for the Casper mattress and unrolled the slats across that.  What I should have done was unroll and open the mattress on top of that.  As it turns out, I didn't do that.  Once the mattress puffed up, I drug it up onto the newly assembled frame and base.  (it's heavy.  even just moving the box up to the second floor of the house was a small challenge in itself).  

From here it was time to wash the bedding, throw it on and try it out.  Let me just say I love the fabric of the sheets!  And, I love these pillows.  By far these are my two favorite features.  

I like how the bed it quiet compared to a traditional mattress/box spring setup.  Myself, or anyone of the 5 animals that frequent the bed, can move around without disturbance.  That is very nice.  

As far as the overall comfort of the bed, it's good.  Okay, I would say it is better than just good.  It's not perfect though.  And I don't think that's what the goal of Casper is.

At first, I was a little nervous about not liking the mattress, as I typically like a firmer mattress and I was worried this would be too soft.

What an incredible company, the customer service was amazing. When I got the mattress, it was so easy to set up, you just remove the box and it pops out.

2239,2016-11-04,Kristina Ellis,34.0,Greenwood, Missouri,4,It's a FANTASTIC Mattress - Just a Little Warm,"When I was shopping for a new mattress, I relied heavily on reviews.  In reading the reviews on Casper's and others' websites, I noticed the proliferation of reviews by people who had just recently purchased the mattress.  I didn't find them particularly helpful given their brief experience with the product.  I heard a commercial for Casper today and decided to write a review.  I have been sleeping on a Casper mattress since May, 2015 and I LOVE IT!  The quality for the price cannot be beat.  It is comfortable and I have not noticed any sagging, dipping, etc. Best of all, my husband's movements do not disturb me nor mine, him.  

Initially, the mattress was too firm and I was waking up with pressure point pain in my shoulder and hip.  I contacted Casper customer service and they were very helpful.  They shipped a two-inch latex mattress topper, at no cost to me, which alleviated the pressure point pain.  I should mention that my husband did not experience anything but a good night's sleep from day one. In fact, he preferred the mattress firmness without the topper, but I won out!   

CONS = Just one. I don't know if it's the additional latex topper, or if the memory foam/latex combination itself sleeps warm, but either way, it can get pretty hot.  That is literally my only complaint.  If you sleep hot, this may be something to consider.  It rarely wakes me, and has really only been an issue in the summer, but there have been times I wake up sweating.  On that note, make sure you purchase a NICE, waterproof mattress cover.  It is the best thing you can do to support the longevity of your mattress.

We received the mattress about a week before we received the box spring.  I definitely recommend buying the box spring as well as the mattress.  We slept much better with the combination instead of just the mattress.  It did take about 10 days for my back to adjust to the new mattress.  My back hurt for the first 10 days.

Delivery of the mattress was great! Real timely and the sheets, pillow, frame and mattress all came in separate good looking boxes a few days apart (i ordered the whole set)

Unboxing the mattress was really simple, although a bit of a hassle pulling the mattress out of the box. The bed frame assembly could not be any easier this is definitely one of the easiest frames i have assembled, literally a one man job.

The pillow is very good, is it expensive? Yes very. Is it worth the price? Maybe not. However if you have the funds pick it up you wont regret it. The Casper sheets as well were good but not worth it. I do not recommend the sheets. While they are quality sheets you can pick up better sheets for a better price elsewhere.

Now for the mattress, i believe this mattress had a lot of hype from the ads and website itself, it is a very good mattress so don't get me wrong, i sincerely believe the price tag is too high for what you are getting. I WAS planning on returning all of my Casper equipment except for the bed frame, however it is a good mattress even if i am feeling a good bit of remorse due to the price.

All in all i spent Around 1400 dollars for a mattress a frame 1 pillow and 1 set of sheets. So i did indeed buy the entire set to get the right experience.

My experience with these products is that the pillow is expensive but worth it, the sheets are a rip-off, the frame is great, and the mattress is overpriced.

My husband puts off a lot of body heat, so if you're a solo sleeper this might be more for you. But when sleeping with someone else, I find I wake up sweating like crazy, even with the AC jacked in the summer and in the dead of winter with the heat at 16C. I've had this for a year and the first 2 weeks was a huge learning curve for my body because I woke up in pain every night for 2 solid weeks. After that, it did start to feel more comfortablebut after hour 7 of sleep, I still wake up feeling like my hips are wedged in a vice. 

I just think it's just too firm for me. It's too late to return it, otherwise, I would. I weigh 120lbs and the firmness of the mattress causes my pelvis to tilt and I wake up in severe pain. My husband loves the bed, but he's heavier and he can sleep sitting up in a car for hours without issueso I donno if his opinion really counts.

I wish I had bought a Sealy. My gut was telling me to, but this was the better deal and I wanted to skip the hell of mattress shopping. Don't get sucked in. As much hassle as it is to go out and lay on 200 mattresses to find the right one, it's worth it for a comfortable sleep. I don't believe in this one size fits all ideology anymore.

When I first read about the Casperand that the idea stemmed from Hotel mattresses, I was stoked, because I always have excellent sleeps in high-end hotels. I thought this was a brilliant idea. However, this mattress does not feel at all like a hotel mattress. Hotel mattresses (in my experience) are always more pillowy and less stiff (but still somewhere in the middle of not being too soft or firm). I would say, from 1-10 (1 being a rock and 10 being a marshmallow) that it's more like a 2 or a 3 than a middle value.

I'd wake up exhausted and grumpy after tossing and turning most of the night and sinking into the spots in my mattress that had lost their support.

It took a while for my boyfriend to finally convince me to buy a new mattress, but I finally decided I had enough. I used a referral from my sister, and bought the Casper. OMG, Even the first night was better.

With that said, the supply chain has a few kinks that need to be worked out, based on my (perhaps unusual!) experience: 

-I ordered it online a few weeks before moving, assuming I could choose a delivery date like you normally can when ordering furniture. NOPE. The next thing I know I get a UPS confirmation that it's on its way. To an apartment I don't live at yet. Send a few frantic emails, they fix it. It'll come the day I move into the new place. Great.

-Actual delivery day rolls around. I check in. It's scheduled for delivery. UPS comes at 6 p.m. No mattress. I call. There's nothing they can do. It's UPS's fault, a number of friendly and less-than-friendly folks tell me, but apart from a $50 credit that I can use to go out into the wide world to buy myself an inflatable air mattress - a somewhat terrifying prospect - they very nicely tell me that I'm screwed. There's no Casper to be found on the whole island of Manhattan (!) and all they'll do for me is give me the number to call UPS.

-Thankfully, my other furniture deliveries came as scheduled, so I put together a couch to sleep on and wake up cranky the next day to the happy news that they're couriering me a mattress that morning. Great. 

-What about the UPS mattress? They'll cancel it, no problem. 

-Well, no. The UPS mattress comes, too. I now have two 90-pound boxes of mattress in my lobby. More emails, more friendly correspondence from Casper folks, annoyed but less so because I'm sleeping well.

Ordering was simple and delivery was fast (even earlier than expected). Unboxing was also really easy. The mattress itself was super comfy after just a couple of days of breaking inno back pain or discomfort, and very little motion transfer. If I lived in a chillier climate I might be inclined to stick with it, but alas, I'm in the humid South, in an apartment that stays pretty warm year round. When I called Casper to set up the return, they were very gracious and helpful, and the pick-up was quickly scheduled for the following week. I also love that they donate returned mattresses to local charities!

I complained to Purolator and went up their chain until I got them to agree to bring it the next day - but that was a fight and still had not real guarantee it could happen (it did though). 

It really soured the whole ordering experience - which really is part of the charm of ordering your product.

The mattress itself seems robust and it breaths fairly nice compared to what we had before for sure. It's pretty firm - more than I expected, but I think I have sort of adjusted. I kind of miss melting into my bed at night, but I do like the sturdiness, so I'm torn.  

One thing I really like is the seam around the edges. It really defines the edge of the bed - whereas on other mattresses you always feel like you might roll off. this one almost makes me feel like the bed itself is a little larger because I can comfortably get super close to the edge. 

The only other tiny gripe I've got is that the top is SO white - it's really beautiful, but I'm sure, over the course of our having the mattress, it is going to get stained one way or another. the, every time I change the sheets, I'm going to see that stain on the white. I wonder f either selling a mattress pad or using the grey on the top might be a better long-term idea? Ask any of the women in your office - a mattress is going to get stained some day - and there's no way to clean it...",8,Sleeps with a partner,439,False,True,False,False,False

Unboxing and watching it expand is fun, and delivery was hassle-free. However, it is a bit too firm for my taste. I'm slim through the torso but have wider hips, and I like to sleep on my side, so I tend to like a softer mattress to allow me to sink in farther--I felt sort of like I was sleeping on a slightly cushy flat plane. If you're a fan of firm mattresses, I think you would really like the Casper, but for me it was on the firm side. I am keeping it, however, with the modification of adding a ~$60 memory foam mattress topper from Amazon--now I get that nice cloudlike feeling I like plus knowing that the mattress underneath is supportive and durable.

Definitely get a mattress protector, it's just good insurance, good for allergies (which I have), and good if you ever need to resell when you move

Even though the old mattress was indented where I slept I had no back pain. In contrast the Casper mattress has given me such severe pain that I take 4 Advil when I go to bed and sometimes in the middle of the night. I wake in the morning exhausted with severe pain in my lower back and hips and can barely stand or walk. I then take more Advil. The first few months the mattress was too hard but I waited for it to break in. Now after one year the mattress is too soft and seems to provide no support. Even the sides of the mattress flatten to such an extent that I can roll off of the bed. I no longer lay down flat to sleep because I am in more pain than if I prop my upper body into a sitting position with pillows. I freely admit that I am overweight. I have osteoarthritis. Probably the deterioration is due to my weight. However if a 20 year old standard mattress and my couch are more comfortable than the Casper something is wrong.

Once it fully opened I just pulled the plastic off of it.  I'm 6 foot, 190 lbs. and it still helped to have my brother assist me in carrying it up my stairs (prior to opening) , so you might want to plan for that. 
I wanted a mattress that was more firm than my previous memory foam mattress.  My hips and lower back were usually sore in the mornings.  I like the latex layer on top.  The springiness and responsiveness of the top layer was a major selling point.   It provides the firmness that I was looking for.  One of the primary reasons that I switched (aside from the aches and pains) was that my gf and I didn't like how the old bed held up under extra curricular activities.  I plan to offer a modest comment on its effectiveness at a later date.  It is, after all, one of the primary uses of a bed.  
I probably saved $1000 choosing casper over a another well known mattress, foam or otherwise.  I looked at reviews of casper v. novos (a competitor) and choose caper because the review said that casper didn't have that quicksand sinking feeling.  Casper is also less expensive.

BE AWARE: Website lies and says if you order by 3pm it will be at your house at night. We purchased it thinking this and got rid of our other mattress. No mattress came. I called and they said it was only for San Francisco, which was not included on their website. We ordered on 8/31 and got it on 9/6. I know it wasn't smart to rid of my other mattress but when you read something on a website you should be able to trust it.

Also, another key reason I got it was because the website said $75 off with code and my friend sent me $50 off code. I was hoping I could use one.

They fail to tell you that if you do their amazing ""0% financing"" that you can't use any codes...misleading and got my to my purchasing window then told me.

Put your bedding on.  Done.  * Be sure to locate the cutter provided in the box - mattress is tightly compressed into heavy plastic wrapping.

MATTRESS:  The nice, airy top is soft and pleasing to the hand.  Mattress is overall somewhat firm, but 'gives' just enough.  Does not ""sleep hot"" (as some people claim about foam mattresses)!  We have had ours 2+ months.  I tend to ""sleep hot"" and have found this mattress does NOT feel hot in the least, so if that's a worry, don't let it be.

RETURN:  In short, my wife.  Buying a mattress is an exercise in diplomacy, as TWO people have to end up liking the same one thing enough to ""live"" on it about one-third of their existence.   We have always had spring mattresses and my wife, who has some back problems, cannot get used to the edges not being as stout as one might find with a conventional metal coil system.  I think she was also accustomed to a slightly softer bed, as our last one was a pillow top.  We still have it and she prefers the feel over this, after trying for several; weeks.  I personally like all aspects of the foam after some adjustment from springs, but lately am having some problems falling asleep.  I don't know if its the mattress or something else, as I have had insomnia before, so I will not blame Casper.

All in all, I am very glad to have been able to try the mattress without fear of being ""out"" the price of it.  I also like having experienced a top quality foam mattress for a third of what some boutique latex ones made nearby sell for (about three times as much and I would pick the casper over them!).  I suspect we will end up with another ""isolated"" or wrapped coil mattress with a pillow top.  As much as I like the foam attributes, that top layer of softness on a pillow-top does tend to spoil - but it also sleeps hotter.

The purchasing experience was smooth and easy, but what truly prompted me to give a 5-star review has as much to do with the outstanding customer service I received as much as the mattress itself.  I ordered the mattress on a Thursday afternoon, and received a shipping notification on Friday morning.  When I checked the shipping status on the following Wednesday morning, the shipping status had not changed, indicating that it was still waiting to be picked up.  I called Customer Service and was served by a guy named Adam(?).  He was very professional and pleasant to deal with, and was responsive to my concern that the mattress was not being delivered, and promised to look into it.  Adam called me back in a short time indicating that the shipping company insisted that the mattress was on its way despite the lack of scans indicating its progress across the country.  Adam proactively and immediately sent another mattress my way in case the original order did not show up.

I think their marketing is best-in-class. But I had a issue with mold with their mattress. I don't blame them for it, but I think they and the foam mattress industry need to be a lot clearer about which foundations will work and which will not. Simply put, you need a foundation with slats. Otherwise you will get mold. 

The other problem is that if you get a slat-based foundation, the slats have to be 3"" or less apart or the mattress will sag. And those curved, cheap Ikea-type slats will not support it even if they're close together. We had this issue with our first Casper, it developed impressions within 3 months!

I also thought I was developing sitting injuries from work because my back hurt in the evenings! (!!!) I was a little worried the Casper might not be as good as the podcasters were saying, but I was fed up with the old one so I was willing to try it. It. Is. Amazing. The gross morning sweat is almost entirely gone, my back's better, and it's just a much comfier snooze cushion.

2729,2016-08-29,Tom Harrison,54.0,Newton, Massachusetts,5,"Compared to our old Tempurpedic, it's as good or better (with a topper)","We had and loved our Tempurpedic mattress for more than 10 years.  We are really picky, and both hated more than several standard spring mattresses we had previously -- none of them lasted, and despite warrantees and premium this and fancy-pants that they all were comfortable for a while, then gave out.  The Tempurpedic lasted, and lasted.  Back in the olden days when we got it we nearly balked at paying nearly $2000 for the mattress and springs.  Fast forward a decade or so, and we found our trusty mattress had finally given up.  Expensive?  Not compared to the three mattresses we tried and hated in the previous 10 years.  No more springs!

So we merrily went to Tempurpedic and tried to figure out how to replace our old mattress with one just like it.  They have so many choices and options we were overwhelmed, but soldiered on -- we can do it, we said. Sales help was not helpful. Then we saw the price tag and it was good we were lying down.  Is it coated with gold?  It's the only rational explanation of the Tempurpdeic's exorbitant cost.

Then we started looking at reviews.  No one really loved the Tempurpedic, but we all agreed: rip off!  But which alternative was better?  Every review said nearly opposite things about any given mattress -- it is as though choosing a mattress is as personal and specific as choosing your spouse.  And, as I think about it, of course it is.  You really don't know anything about them until after a while.  They may look good from the outside but turn out to be lumpy or lovely.

And that's why Casper is better: after a few months, if you're not in love it's ok.

Some well-timed marketing promo arrived, and we got a $50 discount.  After everything I had read, Casper seemed at least to be trying.  So I ordered it.  Easy.  Done.

We have had ours now for a few months, and we're in love, after a little bit of work.  I also love my wife of 20 years and knew within a couple months we would make our relationship work.

Casper is a very good mattress.  The material is durable and it's going to last according to all research I have done.  It's not memory foam, but many people have found memory foam makes them too warm.  It doesn't have ""comfort zones"" or ""sleep numbers"" or anything fancy.  It is a very high quality product.  Choose the size.  Done.  Ships to your front door.

The shipping is pretty sweet, to be sure.  It arrived quickly and unfurled and expanded.  Look, it's a blind-date kind of purchase, what do you need a sales person for anyway?  All they are going to tell you is either a) what *they* like in a bed, or more likely b) which one will get them the best commission.  Casper is no less blind.  Just easier to actually try for real.  And if it's not for you, return.  Even that's supposed to be easy.

My first nights were great.  My wife found the Casper too firm, however.  She was more comfortable with the memory foam of our old mattress.

We wrote the folks at Casper and asked for advice.  An (actual) human wrote a response, using (actual) hand-crafted words, and answered each of my actual questions.  He suggested alternatives including a memory foam mattress topper, with a link to Amazon (and several others, explaining trade-offs).  Brilliant service by actual people.  OK, now I really *want* to like this product.  But I also really *need* to like the product, and so does my wife, because while I appreciate awesome customer service, I am not going to sleep on it for a decade.

So we got a memory foam mattress topper from Amazon ($90) and bada-bing, we're both thrilled.  Actually happier, since we got the ""gel"" memory foam which apparently overcomes some of the issues with memory foam and heat.

It's been a year and a half since we got our Casper and I think that THIS is truly the spot in time when a consumer can be objective with regard to mattress purchase.

We owned many mattresses previous to Casper. And while they were not as quality as Casper, I still think that there are several areas that need improvement. 

The first comment I have is regarding the off-gassing of the mattress post-purchase. I was really sort of shocked to experience such a strong off-gassing of chemical smell after purchase and surprised at the duration of the off-gassing. My suggestion here is that you bring some attention to the chemicals used in the mattress, what fire retardants are used, where changes can be made comparable to American/European standards AND take a look at toxic effects of off-gassing and breathing of these chemicals for 8 hours per night everyday for months on end. Take a step beyond your competitors and recognize this problem:)

My second critical comment is that a year and a half later, there is a definite ""bowl shape"" occurring where my husband sleeps and also on my side but less so. We aren't obese people. He's about 210, I'm about 150. So perhaps more can be done support-wise to encourage the integrity of the mattress. I'm afraid that a year from now, it could be pretty bad, but we'll see I guess:)

While sleeping in the dirt overseas while serving on deployments, I told myself I would one day get a bed that would allow me to sleep in complete and undisturbed peace. Back in those days, that was a hard feat to accomplish, and until recently had proved the same. I had slept on a futon when I returned back to the United States, and only after I decided that the dirt was more comfortable than the futon, it was time for me to get a mattress. A Casper mattress. I did extensive research on the best and brightest mattresses around the US and did the best I could at comparing top competitors to the Casper, but in the end I trusted my instincts about the company, the care, and the project so that night I was online and had a complete bed on its way! I'm talking sheets, pillows, comforter, the whole shebang. I waited only one day and my mattress arrived. A sweet 92 pound rectangle of goodness waiting to be slept on and already at the house. I unpackaged the bed, it was a great unwrapping experience and then made the bed with my older sheets, waiting on the Casper ones to arrive the next day. And they did, and I made the bed and kid you not I have never slept so well in all of my life as I have on this Casper mattress. I continue to make that bed, and enjoy sleeping in it every single day or night. Casper, my friends, well done. My health, my brain, my back, my heart thanks you all!

I had followed Casper for a couple years, so when their cute little added started up on our beloved Stories Podcast, I new it was a sign.  In general we are happy.  I am a little full-figured (170lbs) and my husband is 215, but 6'3"" and well distributed.  I still think we would LOVE it, if it was a bit firmer.

I have to be honest, Casper, my biggest fear and reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that I worry how this bed will hold up over time.  Will I *really* get 10 years out of it?  Will I even get 5?  I am not sure.  I wonder if we won't have the same sagging issue in a few years.  I do think there should be more support on the perimeter of the bed, too.  (I notice my husband and I now sleep closer together.   Not a terrible thing, but an indication that the edges/sides of the bed aren't supportive enough for sleeping.)",8,Sleeps with a partner plus a dog,478,False,True,False,True,False

Even though the mattress was very reasonably priced, we were taking a risk since there weren't many reviews out there and no stores for us to try the mattress first.  Now we can't imagine life without it.  We talk like huge dorks about our mattress to all our friends and act like crazy Casper salesmen whenever anyone is talking about needing a new mattress.  I researched beds like crazy because we didn't want to waste our money. I was concerned about seeing dips in a foam mattress, but in 2 years its still as firm yet soft as ever.  Its such an adaptable mattress in so many ways:  if you put an elbow in the mattress it sinks in like the mattress is soft, but if you're laying flat, it feels firm and supportive.  It has also adapted from being shared with our little dog to now being shared with our 3 month old during midnight feedings.  I can slip in bed beside my husband multiple times a night without ever waking or shaking him.  If you like snacking in bed, you can plop down beside a glass of water or icecream bowl with no tipping or spilling--there's just so little motion transfer.  My husband, who is a straight thug,  even talks openly about his mattress at bars and fantasy drafts and man-ish places with steaks and beer where mattresses simply do not come up in conversation.

I'd been eyeing up the Casper mattress for a while but had no use to buy one because I was sleeping on a free mattress from my parents. I loved that I could order the mattress online and have it shipped to me because I don't have a car and being new to the area, didn't really have anyone I could rely on to take me mattress shopping. It arrived the same night I flew in and opening it up (after a few welcome to Austin drinks) was a blast.

I read over 30 reviews on this mattress, good and bad. I have to say, I honestly can't believe anyone says this mattress is ""too firm"" or ""like sleeping on the floor."" I can only imagine they were sleeping on water beds before if they are saying that. The mattress is firm, but it also has a cushy top layer, so it provides support AND comfort. I'm also not sure about the reviews that you can feel every movement of another person, as I have now had the mattress for 1.5 months and had multiple pups (I'm a dog sitter) as well as another person sharing the mattress with me. I've never slept sounder with a pet or other person in my bed in my life. I don't feel a thing...sometimes I didn't even know the dog had jumped up on the bed.

For the last few years I've been getting a lot larger, and my old memory foam mattress was getting destroyed. I was just too heavy (at ~260lbs), and my old memory foam mattress (which I paid roughly $1,500 for) would sink down really low.

This made sleeping really uncomfortable for me, and ended up causing all sorts of lower back issues. Instead of being able to sleep comfortably, my lower back would ache through the night, and when I woke up I'd need to stretch quite a bit before all my normal mobility returned.

Things were getting sort of ridiculous.

So, I did a lot of research about good mattresses for athletes, recovery, etc., which is how I stumbled across Casper.

I finally bought it a few months ago, and it has been AMAZING.

It was starting out to be a hot summer, and we had been thinking of getting a Casper for a while. The thought of lounging in the water on a Casper and then going to sleep on a Casper was enough to push us to make the order. When we placed the order it was around the time that Canada Post was threatening to strike. We received a prompt email from Casper letting us know they were using another delivery method but delivery may be slower than normal due to increased volumes. No problem. The mattress arrived a few days later, we unpacked it, and all was well. It unpacked quickly and easily with only a faint smell that dissipated over a few hours. No pool mattress though. We checked out the T&C and realized it might be sent separately. After a few more days, we still hadn't received it. We checked out the T&C again and noticed the quantities were limited and only the first certain number of orders got a pool mattress. We had ordered really quickly after the announcement, so we figured we would certainly be within the cutoff for a pool mattress, so we sent an email to Casper just to be sure. No response. Radio silence. To this day, no one has responded to our email. That really bugs me. If we weren't entitled to one, no big deal! All they need to say is ""there were 500 pool mattresses and you were order 501! Sorry guys!"" But instead we are left wondering what happened. In this day and age, a customer service email should never go unanswered. Never.

Anyway, enough about the pool mattress (or lack thereof) and the customer service (or lack thereof), back to the mattress. Lying on it is comfortable. I will say that I'm not totally convinced that it is giving us a better night sleep than our old box store mattress. There has been a lot of tossing and turning in my house on the Casper. To be fair, like I said, it has been a hot summer, and a guy named Rodney moved in to a house on our street a few weeks ago. Rodney has a lot of late night arguments with his friends and girlfriends. So I am not ready to say the poor sleeping is caused by the Casper, but I also can't blame it all on Rodney at this point.

Shipping/Delivery: UPS is hands down the worst shipping company this side of the universe, making even Canada Post seem great. But - that aside - the box and unpacking of it was great! I just wish there was a way to get the mattress back in the box next time I move.

First Impression: It seemed really soft when I sat on it, which made me worry a little bit (especially since a lot of reviews commented on how firm it was!).

First Night: I slept like a happy cat. When you lay on it, the mattress is beautifully supportive and doesn't feel like... Jell-O like some of the other all-foam mattresses I tried.

The Cats: Couple things - one - the mattress is so solid, I can't feel them jumping on and off (and on and off and on and off) throughout the night. Two - one of them decided the middle of the mattress was the perfect place to cough up a hairball. I was surprised at how quickly and forgiving it was to clean up, despite being so white!

I did also get the pillow - figured it was worth a try - and it definitely was! My only issue is that my cat also LOVES it, so I wind up fighting him for space in the morning.

In addition, the mattress is dented in the spot where I sleep. I called customer service and they were not helpful at all. They said others had reported it as a hard mattress and that they would give me $50 for a mattress topper which is not what I am looking for.

3006,2016-08-06,CF,31.0,Davis, California,3,Good product that's not for me,"A friend told me about Casper. Moving towns, I wanted a mattress to arrive right at arrival. Casper provides free to-door shipping, and my mattress was waiting for me the day I moved in. I also do not particularly enjoy making decisions, so I was attracted to Casper's one size fits all approach. I very much wanted to like the mattress; it was extremely easy (and fun) to unwrap; I liked its aesthetics; and I like the company. I slept on my Casper for 1 month. Despite my desire to love the product, I found myself sleeping more lightly and with some back discomfort. If anything, the mattress seemed a bit too firm for my liking. It's quite possible that having just moved provided a stressor that contributed in part (or in entirety) to this poor sleep. Yet, for 900 dollars, I did not want a product that felt simply OK. In the end, I am returning the mattress (which Casper makes exceptionally easy to do), and I bought a Simmons BeautyRest Luxury Firm Hybrid Baylee instead. For me, the layer of memory foam in my new mattress provides a bit more give than the Casper.
I guess my punchline is this: 
I liked my Casper OK. But it was not great, for ME. Given how varied people are in their tastes, I would be surprised if any mattress could be the magic bullet for everyone.

The major problem here is that we have an extremely high bar with mattresses.... our current mattress is an organic latex (""lay""-tex) mattress with a bamboo topper - the total set up probably cost around $3K.

The first few nights, it was hard to get used to the Casper mattress, mainly because it feels different... more 'squishy'... but I finally got a few good nights worth of sleep. I then returned to my usual mattress, and could tell a difference for sure.

The sides are very soft. Sitting on the bed basically results in sliding right off. In fact, the first night I almost rolled off the bed. The fabric along the sides seems a little baggy as if the foam isn't filling out the casing. I do wish it was slightly taller and noticed that it looked a bit thin when all was said and done.

I did however wake up the next morning feeling as if my whole right side, shoulder, arm, hip, and leg had received a light paddling, but that was the one and only time that happened, and I have to assume it was a reaction to the change from years on a pretty rock-hard futon.
I suffer from periodic insomnia, which was the primary reason that an ND told me to get rid of my OLD mattress pronto. I have to say that the Casper has not cured this, but nevertheless, even on terrible nights, it is wonderful to sleep/rest on. It feels like an amazingly supportive cloud!

My biggest concerns came with the mattress itself and the firmness of it. I decided to go with a Casper after reading multiple reviews between it and the Tuft and Needle. I also have 2 friends who have Caspers and a few others who have Tuft and Needles so I got to actually try them out prior to my purchase.

Sadly my mattress feels way more firm than any of the Casper and Tuft and Needles I tried out. I also had a few friends who own them come test mine out and share their thoughts and all agreed it was way more firm and contained hardly any sinkage compared to their beds.

Contacted support who were very friendly and looked into it to get more information on the issue and made some suggestions on trying it on the floor or getting a new frame etc. The frame is one 3 of 5 people who helped me test it out have as well so I feel that is not the issue. They also mentioned a break-in period which I brought up to my lovely tester friends who said they never recall it being so firm and would be very off-put getting that to start with.

All in all I will probably be sending it back before my 100 night trial is up, certainly worth a shot but hopefully I get a softer mattress from Tuft and Needle or one of the other competitors as my mattress was not comfortable (friends were so certainly give it a shot).",6,Sleeps solo,533,False,False,True,False,False

I left a note on my buzzer at my apartment that read ""Casper Delivery for Kyle, Buzz for _______ (last name)."" In the note, I had asked them to buzz for my fiancee's last name because she was going to be home.  She took the day off work to be there for the mattress when it arrived. At around 4 PM, I asked her if she had heard anything from UPS or Casper, she said she hadn't heard anything. I decide to look at the tracking info, which now shows that the mattress could not be delivered because my name wasn't on the buzzer..........even though there was a note right below the buzzer buttons that stated clear instructions to buzz for my fiancee's last name. 

I completely understand mishaps happen, so I am not all that frustrated when I reach out to Casper. I let the representative know that UPS did not attempt to reach out to my fiancee via buzzer or phone, and did not leave a notice that they even came. The only way we knew was because we proactively checked the tracking info. The representative was pleasant and apologetic, but very unhelpful. She informed me that UPS ""sometimes doesn't read notes and isn't required to adhere to the instruction in the notes."" After asking what she could do to get the package to be re-delivered in the same day, she informed me that was simply not possible, and that we would have to wait until tomorrow to receive the shipment. (My fiancee had taken the day off work to receive this shipment and neither of us would be able to take any time off for the rest of the week). The representative's advice was to leave a note for the UPS person to leave the package outside the gate and pick it up when I get home. Yes, the same representative who told me UPS does not read notes, told me to leave a note for UPS to leave our $950 mattress......on the streets of Chicago.....to indefinitely get stolen.

One of the main reasons we looked into Casper was because we heard about the unmatched customer service and how great the experience with delivery was (we had just moved into a new place and needed a new mattress). As excited as we were to not only get this mattress, but experience the ""unmatched"" customer care Casper offers, I am sad to say I was left extremely disappointed in my experience. For the amount of money we put out for this mattress, I am shocked at the lack of a customer solution that was presented to me.

As for the mattress itself; I do not believe, and I am positive proof thereof, that there exist one mattress for the masses.  There are just too many variables; thus the incredible amount of reviews, both positive and negative, for so many different mattress types and brands including Casper.

3317,2016-07-05,Meagan,23.0,Milwaukee, Wisconsin,5,I'm Obsessed,"Background: I graduated from college a year ago and needed to buy a mattress. I love my sleep and have been wanting to find the ideal mattress so I can get better sleep and ultimately sleep less to have more time. I spent a couple days researching and ended up buying a Casper.

First Impression: As the website says, it can take time to adjust. At first, I liked it but was used to my foam topper so the mattress was a bit too hard for me at first. 

After Adjusting: But after a couple weeks, I had adjusted and now a year later I am still obsessed with my Casper. It reminds me of Goldilocks - not too hard, not too soft, but just right. Based on the research I had done it makes sense. ""Too soft"" beds usually have a lot of foam but foam traps you (if you move you might wake up slightly) and traps in heat. The latex combo helps with this and finds the right balance between making the mattress soft but not too soft. There are no springs to jab you either. 

The sheets: I finally caved and bought the sheets to replace my Amazon best seller sheets (which barely lasted a year). While they are just sheets and the mattress is what really effects my sleep, I am happy with the purchase. They have a different feel than other sheets that I cannot figure out how to put in words beyond how they are explained on this website. I got what I paid for!

The Price: Some might question why it is cheaper and that means the quality goes down. Sometimes but I do not believe that is the case. The company has a smart business strategy - minimizing cost in many areas to keep the product cost low. And you are not paying for a name brand which are the opposite - very overpriced.

Is it for everyone? While no mattress can be perfect for everyone, this mattress in my eyes is the closest possible option for appealing to the majority of people.",8,Sleeps with a partner,543,False,True,False,False,False

The problem: Both my wife and I would wake up with sore backs, and my hands would go numb, even after several weeks. It was just too firm for our particular bodies. 

Having said that, delivery was smooth except for the UPS man who almost didn't get it to us. The unboxing was fun; our 14-month-old baby loved it. The mattress was clearly high quality; it was exactly what the designers wanted it to be and very deliberate in every detail. I think if our bodies were a little different it would be great.

The mattress sort of falls into the cliche of ""jack of all traits, master of none"". It's firmness, softness, and bounce all fall into the middle of the road when comparing to other mattresses. This trait helps if you have back and/or hip pains as it provides the comfort with the support. However, if you're a big softy or prefer laying on wood planks then this mattress isn't for you. The Casper also is fairly cool for a foam mattress, I have been able to get good night sleeps in the dead of summer with it. My only complaint is that it may be SLIGHLTY too firm for side sleepers, yet it is extremely comfortable with sleeping on your back. Overall, buying the Casper was a risk but the reward payed off. It is a great all-arounder, and while you may not be super impressed with it when you first jump in, you'll wake up extremely relaxed and refreshed. Plus, the price is fairly reasonable, especially when compared to big name brands with similar materials and feel.

3385,2016-06-28,J H,51.0,Lima, Ohio,1,Casper Pillow,"I purchased a Casper mattress and decided to add the Casper pillow to my purchase the next day (the mattress was still in my cart).  I used a promotional code for the mattress to receive $50 off of the purchase price of the ""mattress"".  The pillow was a supportive disaster immediately.  The pillow literally offers no support and unless you are a stomach sleeper (I begin on my back and then end up on my side) this pillow is highly inadequate.  I gave it more than a week; I guess thinking that maybe something would magically change.  Unfortunately, nothing changed and I woke up with an extremely sore neck from the lack of support every day.  I finally gave up and went back to my old shredded memory foam pillow (thankfully, I had not thrown it out yet).  I'm not sure how any back or side sleeper is experiencing a good nights sleep with this pillow.  In fact, if one just pushes down in the middle of the pillow with even the slightest amount of pressure the pillow will completely flatten out.  Taking into consideration that the average human head weighs more than ten pounds that's not very reassuring.  The only positive aspect was that the pillow did stay very cool but that's not much of a trade off for a sore neck.  So, I contacted customer service and requested to return the pillow.  They emailed me a return label.  It was then that I noticed that they had actually deducted the $50 promotional discount from the mattress purchase against the refund of the pillow.  So, I am only being refunded $25.00 for the pillow.  The promotional discount DOES NOT and DID NOT apply to the pillow.  So much for the transparent and ""legendary"" customer performance experience.  That truly is a practice that I would anticipate from a ""fly-by-night"" business but not what I expected after reading all of the overblown hype concerning Casper.

I stayed at an Air BnB for work for about a month that had a Casper mattress, and I fell so in love with the soft-but-firm texture that, when time came to replace my own mattress at home, I bought a Casper. However, I was super disappointed when I got the mattress because it was extremely HARD! Like, almost like a rock- too firm. And nothing like the cooler, slightly-firmer-tempurpedic-type bed that had convinced me to buy it.

However, after doing some general digging on the internet, I saw that many people reported the mattress being too firm at first, and it softening over time. This obviously means it works for some, not all. I've only been on mine for 1 month, and after only 4 weeks, I feel a significant difference in how firm it is. Lots of friends who've stayed over have remarked on how comfy it is. I wouldn't recommend it to someone with severe back problems (unless you've got a friend to sleep on it for you for a while!), but it looks like the general trend of ""sleep on it for a bit and it'll soften up"" is true. I am hoping it eventually ends up like the Casper I slept on at that Air BnB- which was the most comfy mattress I've ever slept on!

I also purchased the sheet set. I was very disappointed when the sheets arrived with a ""made in India"" label. $180 and made in India????? Ridiculous.

But, the mattress is too soft for me. I wake with a lower backache. I have read to sleep on the mattress for a couple of weeks to see if my back will adjust. I slept on it for one week with headaches and backaches, then I went out of town for a week and had no headaches and no backaches. Now I have been sleeping on the Casper for five nights and, again, am experiencing headaches and backaches. I even bought a sheet of 3/4"" plywood and put it between the box springs and the mattress; that did not make the mattress any firmer and did not stop my backaches.

While I am glad to have something off a mattress that doesn't go on sale, I think percentage off coupons are more fair.  Customers that spend more money should receive more off.  I realize it is planned that way because most people spend more than the minimum, and the small amount  that buy the minimum are getting the benefit from those that pay more, but again I think the ones that are buying the more expensive products should be rewarded for spending more-maybe even with a greater percentage off coupon than the minimum buyers.

When we pulled into the driveway, it was on the front porch as requested. We carried it in and placed it in the master bedroom. The opening instructions were simple and perfect. The opening tool that came with the instructions was ingenious and although I didn't time it, I would say start to finish took us less than 5 minutes. No lie. Bing, bam, boom. Done. 
We had been sleeping on our OOOOOLLLLDDDDD (18+ years!! ACK!) mattress prior to our move and was looking forward to our new mattress in our new home. We had no idea. All I can say is this; Every single person who has come to our home so far has been offered a chance to lay on our bed so they can feel how glorious it is. I think I made a few sales! It feels like sleeping on a supportive cloud. It cradles your body in all the right places and feels like you're floating. When my spouse moves, I can't even feel it. He has a serious case of ""Jimmy Legs"" and normally wakes me 8,000 times a night. Since we've had our new Casper mattress, I don't know when he moves, gets up, rolls over, nothing. It's *almost* like sleeping alone. It's wonderful!!

Due to PTSD + medications, insomnia is a side effect.  I would wake approx every 2-3 hours, any sleep I did get was intermittent, and I had not slept soundly in years.  The poor quality of my sleep significantly affected my mood, job performance, and every day functioning. I used to love a hard mattress, but seemed to have changed my tolerance; my futon mattress felt like pounded sand.  Strangely, I didn't connect the two ideas (discomfort = lack of sleep) because I had slept on super-firm mattresses all of my adult life to that point.  I had chalked it all up to symptoms. 

My family thoughtfully sent me the Casper, and from day one I slept as I have never slept before: deeply (enough to dream) and soundly (through the night w/out waking).  It was nothing short of miraculous and I say this without hyperbole - I get my required amount of sleep most every night, I rise feeling rested, and my irritability has decreased significantly.  While I still have approx 1-3 nights p/week where I cannot sleep due to the meds/symptoms, just having a majority of solid nights of rest gives me more quality of life.

- Delivery to my doorstep in a box that was relatively easy to get up the stairs by myself
- After giving it a suggested month of sleeping on it, I was able to get a cushioned topper and that made a huge difference
- Quick, easy 6-month financing through Affirm

CONS:
- Too firm; I have a preference for a softer, more plush mattress and when I called to inquire about a cushion top after a couple of weeks, I was told to give it 2-3 more weeks which was annoying because I know pretty quickly whether it is comfortable or not
- Was happy to get the cushioned topper but I feel like it should've been shipped to me free of charge ... which it kind of was but I still had to pay shipping (whatever, not a huge deal)
- I was also told that the shipping a free topper would most likely be a limited-time program but I would highly discourage that; why would you want to lose customers over a too firm/too soft problem that could easily be remedied with the topper?

I knew of Casper and I was familiar with their brand but to be honest I had some reservations. How could a mattress that's basically foam, comes rolled up in a box, and costs substantially less than competing mattresses provide the support I need to get me through the night? It is safe to say that I was very surprised. My only advice is to take them up on their 100 night trial, I'm confident that once you try their mattress you'll be just like me.

 However, the mattress was awfully soft, lacked mid body support, lacks sitting edge support, and caved inward on my middle body.

After one to two weeks of trying the mattress nightly,  the feeling did not change and the mattress could rarely be used successfully during that time.  After three weeks, the issue was discussed with customer service by phone.  The credit, pickup, and return was completed in one to  three days.

Phone rep advised this soft feeling is not a usual experience and offered to exchange and replace it right away,  which a few days later I declined any replacement.    The experience did not want to be repeated without success.   The Latex material lacks support from my other experiences with latex.    The industry coil mattresses give better support with contouring pressure points and being either too soft or too hard.

I went to a mattress store with a price (800-1200) set in mind and was overwhelmed with the selection above my budget. Frustrated and looking for alternatives I read the reviews for casper and thought I would give it a try. I poured over online reviews on quality, comfort, and customer service (they have stellar ratings) and felt semi-confident.
Shipping was reasonable and unboxing was straightforward. Its a great looking mattress, modern and stylish.
 I just moved and did not have a bed frame so I had the mattress on the floor for the first few weeks. Initially, my back was sore when I would wake in the morning. I thought maybe the mattress was too firm being on  the floor but I stubbornly persisted. Then, my partner moved in with me and brought an ikea bed frame that fit the mattress snug. Once we got the mattress off the floor my morning soreness disappeared. 
The casper mattress is just the right amount of firmness for me and my partner, we get restful sleep. We don't sink in the bed and can turn on our sides without waking up (there's some review about turning being such an effort that it wakes people up). I am a light sleeper and do not wake up when he climbs into bed or gets up in the middle of the night. I do not sweat or feel abnormally hot on this mattress.

3821,2016-04-23,Monica,28.0,Madison, Wisconsin,5,Absolutely worth it!,"This is a wonderful mattress. I am so very glad I took the gamble to buy it! Let me break it down:
Ordering and arrival: Very easy. The website is straightforward, no hassle, and once I had made my choice and placed the order it came in about 1 week. It arrived in a giant box that was pretty heavy but manageable (especially if you've got someone helping you). Opening it up and unpacking it wasn't a problem and instructions were clear. It took about 15-20 minutes to cut out of packaging and then we let it rest for an extra 15 minutes more just to ""puff up"" and air out. Slept on it the same night.

Mattress itself: Very comfortable! To give context, prior to this I had a completely latex foam mattress from Ikea, which was ok through college and a little beyond but it was time to upgrade. I was looking very specifically for a larger mattress, with more height to give support, medium level of softness, and not ridiculously heavy because there's a strong chance I will move in the next 1-2 years. I immediately passed over getting a memory foam mattress because my personal experience is that  they are frankly too soft and trap heat. Also, very pricey when you start looking at anything beyond a Full/twin size. I landed on Casper because I had heard good things about it online. One of the things that really sold me was actually checking for video reviews where I could visually assess the kind of give the mattress had under the weight of a person. This mattress has more softness than a latex, but more support than memory foam (none of that trapped sinking feeling), and is good at temperature maintenance. I share my mattress with another person (and occasionally a cat) and it doesn't transfer movement through the mattress very much. I haven't moved the mattress yet, but based on when we first got it I am not concerned. It is fairly flexible so I don't expect any problems navigating door frames and hallways, which is much more manageable than a traditional spring mattress. The only complaint I really have is that the edge of the mattress is not supportive, so if you sit on the edge to futz with putting on socks or something you sink and slide off a bit. Not really a big issue and certainly outweighed by the other benefits.

Cost and other stuff: Very affordable (especially if you're only just getting on your feet as a financially -independent person). I haven't had much need to interact with customer service, but so far it has been very positive. Part of what drew me to Casper, aside from the mattress itself, was that I had come across multiple positive reviews of their generous and flexible return policy. I can't personally say if it's truly that good--because I want to keep my mattress!--but it certainly gave me a little peace of mind before I decided to purchase. Finally, my cat loves this mattress and has stopped sleeping on my pillow or legs as often because the mattress is apparently more comfortable!

I like cushiness, but am generally okay with medium firmness.  In my opinion, this is firmer than that.  Maybe I'll get used to it (I already have, to a point).  The mattress itself seems well-made, un-boxing was fun (and as easy as they claimed), and it was ready to use immediately.

It was easy to order, arrived quickly, and was easy to set up, though the ""unboxing"" was overrated for a full-size mattress. It just unfolded. I do think it is very firm, maybe a tad firmer than I would like, but not really an issue so far. I do use a padded mattress cover but not a topper. I may get a topper. I do have a little lower back pain but I don't think it's related to the mattress - will give it some more time. I have not had any issues with it being hot. I always get hot when sleeping and it is no different than with my old innerspring mattress. It is very stable, meaning it doesn't bounce a lot or move when I move, which I think would be good if I had a partner. I do wish it had more stiffness at the edges because it does squish down a bit more than I like when I sit down at an edge. I know that some foam mattresses have a wedge structure at the edges for this. I am using it on an LL Bean platform bed that has very strong slats that are 2.75"" apart and it works perfectly - plenty of stability, just like being on a solid wood base.

There are several names that pop up regularly but decided on Casper based on reviews, return policy and ease of the process, simplicity of the website and mostly the simple selection of one gimmick free mattress design. It just seems like there is no need for so many options or claims of cooling layers or special layers to rest your muscles or special scientific layers.

The mattress is just firm enough so you don't sink in feeling trapped, yet your body just settles where it needs to naturally in the mattress. I was leaving a spring mattress and there is no comparison, this is just so comfortable everytime I go to sleep.

I didn't notice any chemical odor. The aroma that was faintly detectable at the very first was even vaguely pleasant.
My own personal preference would be for a mattress that's a tiny bit softer.

Consumer Reports rated Casper highly but I was reluctant to buy a mattress without trying it first. I spent two days wandering from local store to store and came away just totally dazed by all the different technologies, options within models within brands, sales spiels and deals, etc. So I went back and read about Casper some more. I didn't see how just one model, and pretty inexpensive at that, could work for everyone but people reported Casper really did honor their 100 day free trial so I decided to give it a try more or less in desperation.

It arrived on time delivered right to my door in a waist high, cardboard box in good condition. Inside, the mattress was folded and compressed in a heavy, sealed, plastic bag. A box cutter was included to open the bag. The instructions that said not to split the bag until the mattress is in the room where you want it aren't kidding. It erupted out of the bag, flopped open and expanded with a whoosh. There was a slight plastic odor but I couldn't smell it any more when I went back in the room a few hours later to go to bed.

Casper says several places that you need to sleep on the mattress for at least 30 days before you decide whether you like it. They aren't kidding about that either. The first week my lower back, shoulders and  hips all ached. I doubted whether I'd be able to stand it for 30 days. The second week all the pains started subsiding. I've had it about a month now and nothing hurts except I sleep so long in one position, my neck aches when I wake up sometimes. I've been experimenting with pillows.

Casper is not what I thought I wanted in a mattress -- but it turns out it is exactly what I needed. I came from a land of feather beds, pillow tops, memory foam, and goose down. I loved that feeling of sinking deep into my bed, wrapped up in a cocoon and every evening I looked forward to getting into bed. But-- I would also toss and turn, wake up throughout the night and constantly readjusting myself when an arm or a leg would go numb. Then I realized I was putting all my value into my mattress on how it felt when I first got into it -- not how well I was sleeping.

Casper is a lot firmer than my previous beds, which initially surprised me. At first I did not like it-- at all. To me, it felt like I was sleeping on a large couch cushion. Yes, there was a little ""sink"" to it, but far less than I was used to. But after a few days, I suddenly realized that I never woke up in the middle of the night; never had to readjust my sleeping position because of a numb limb or a sore shoulder. I was sleeping through the entire night. And it felt amazing!

Casper redefined my notion of what a good bed is; a good bed should be judged on the quality of sleep it provides. I treat my bed differently now -- I am not so inclined to spend hours in it in the evening before sleep, nor do I have that ""ooo I want to go climb into bed because it is so comfy"" desire. But I do get the best sleep of my life. And that, I realized, should be the only thing that matters.

My husband, on the other hand, loved it from the beginning. He had been suffering lower back pain from our old hand-me-down mattress and was practically cured after the first night with the Casper.

On the one hand I like the premise of the company and what they are trying to do with the industry.  That said I feel their marketing is dishonest in claiming that it is the perfect mattress for everyone.  Initially out of the box, the mattress was too firm for both me and my wife.  Way too firm.  I suspect it will be too firm for most people.  

Undeterred, we gave the mattress a few weeks to see if our bodies would adapt.  Eventually my wife came to tolerate - not love - the mattress.  It remains too firm for me (though I must say the motion isolation is very nice).  We both feel that if it were just a little softer it would be a great mattress.   

Given our busy schedules, we unfortunately let the trial period lapse.  Shame on us.  Now we will either have to get rid of it or buy an expensive 3rd party mattress topper for me to get a good night's sleep.

My recommendation for everyone is to negotiate with Casper before your trial period ends regarding options to soften it up or return it.  Once the trial period ends, their stellar customer service will disappear.  This is unfortunate as I really want to like and recommend the company (and would purchase sheets and pillows if treated with better service after the sale).",7,Sleeps with a partner,647,False,True,False,False,False

Over the years, we have spent tens of thousands of dollars on mattresses. Yes, I said tens of thousands.

We have had the Casper for a month now but I am starting to notice that the mattress under my hips/butt is much softer than anywhere else. Not sure if the whole mattress will become this soft or it's just because I have more pressure placed there? As well, it's usually the spot where I spin myself out of bed and sit up.

4344,2016-03-06,Kaylee,27.0,Hanford, California,5,Different in a good way,"The mattress I was sleeping on before was a 13 year old spring mattress that has seen waaaay better days. The unboxing of my new Casper mattress was an interesting one to say the least. First of all, I was very surprised to receive my mattress only 2 days after purchasing it. Second, it came in a rectangular box about 4ft by 2.5 ft. I was expecting a mattress shaped box or bag covered mattress. Even my delivery guy had quite a time locating the box in his van due to it's unassuming shape. Since the Casper is made of all squishy bits, it was able to be vacuum sealed into this rectangular box. As soon as I took the plastic off the mattress, it immediately started to go back into mattress shape. It took probably a total of 3 minutes before I looked like it would never have fit in the box. I've had issues before with similar products needing to sit over night to fully expand but Casper was good to go in about 10 minutes. 
In preparation of this new mattress, I built myself a new platform bed for the mattress to sit on since my previous bed was a smaller size. I was initially worried that the mattress would slip and slid on the smooth surface of the platform but I can honestly say this mattress is not going anywhere. It is unexpectedly heavy so I would definitely recommend moving it to where you want it before opening the box - especially if you're going it alone. It was a little more firm than I was expecting but I quickly got use to it. The only draw back that I have encountered so far is that because it is so dense, it is quite a bit warmer than a traditional mattress. I sleep with multiple fans pointing at me year round anyway so a little direction adjusting and some thinner blankets was all it took for me to be comfortable.

It feels very firm, but at the same time I haven't had any issues with pressure points. I sleep on my side a lot so it's nice to not have my hip hurt or my arms go to sleep from pinched nerves. The pressure comes from all directions in contact with the mattress - almost like a hammock, but with a give. 

The movement isolation is really good too - I'm a light sleeper so now I don't wake up every time my husband gets up in the night, or when he tosses and turns. It's also telling that when the tumble of our two dogs romp on the bed (though they don't sleep with us because they track dirt in the sheets) it doesn't jostle the bed very much. 

The Casper beats the tar out of our old inner spring mattress we had, with its 10 years of wear and tear and divots. I did go ahead and get a solid platform frame for the Casper, partly so our old bed became the quest/cat bed but also to give the Casper the most even surface to work with.

I try to explain to people what it's like to sleep in a Casper bed.

It's cushy in all of the right places but still firm enough to not make you think you're going to sink all of the way through it. It probably helps that I'm also a bit of a bedding junkie so I have great pillows and a down comforter that take the whole experience to another level. I seriously spend more time in this bed than I have any other bed I've owned.

Hubby likes a hard surface, I like soft as am a side sleeper with shoulder problems.  We both have back issues.   We both got some back pain relief from going from our old spring mattress to this one and it was a pretty good hard/soft compromise.  

BEST thing is that I am not woken up every five minutes when the hubby turns over or gets up.  Old mattress would practically bounce me out of the bed.

If asked for a recommendation I might highlight the innovative purchasing process / interesting brand persona you have but I would not say it's a great bed by any means.

Why? After a while I think the mattress has started to mould somewhat to my body - and not necessarily in a good way. It's like sinking into a groove, which seems a bit weird. Even after 8-9 hours of sleep I often wake up feeling exhausted. I can't necessarily blame the bed. Maybe it's something else.

Im too embarrassed to state how long we had our previous mattress.  Though it was a Simmons Beautyrest with a nice pillow top, we had kept it long past its expiration date.  However, mattresses are an expensive investment, and we had just not been able to afford a new one.  As such, my wifes slumber was increasingly interrupted by insomnia and afterwards haunted by sore back and shoulder muscles from our blown out bed.

For years she suffered in this fashion, and though we had visited storefront mattress stores before and also read a few articles about how to select a mattress, it is still a process fraught with many perils.  Aside from the high cost, theres also the nagging uncertainty that the mattress you eventually choose wont be the one.  How can you know from 10 minutes prone in a store that your final selection will prove out?

We had looked at other mattress brands previously, but the reviews were mixed to say the least.  Many did not have high ratings for longevity or comfort, and some were reputed to smell awful.  Then the Casper ads began to appear on our local BART trains, and I heard them in my podcasts.  No storefront meant a much lower cost and we were interested in the latex & memory foam styles, so we decided to investigate further.  The reviews for the Casper mattress were almost uniformly glowing, and the following video below sealed the deal for us.

The ordering process at the Casper website was almost absurdly simple, and text messages sent to customer support were replied to within hours. Their reps responses were very warm and personable.  The one caveat which I would strongly recommend is that prior to placing your order with Casper; set up a UPS account.  All Casper mattresses are shipped through UPS, and having a UPS account will give you the option of being able to specify certain delivery details.

This was vital for us, as my wife and I work during the week and are usually not home when delivery trucks make their rounds.  Finding the right time slot was a challenge, and I had initially wanted a signature requirement upon delivery.  When this proved impractical due to a slight delay in transit, being able to alter the delivery conditions was a source of great relief.  We live in an apartment, and certainly did not want our package left near the sidewalk.  Having the UPS account allowed us to specify that the package be left on our second floor balcony away from the street.

When the package finally arrived I eagerly wrestled it into our bedroom and began the unpacking.  The contents were simple, and I was delighted to discover that the mattress requires no breathing time.  Because of its particular method of manufacture, it is not doused in fire retardant or any other noxious chemicals.  Once you unwind the outer plastic sheet and CAREFULLY open the inner bag in which the mattress has been compressed, stand back and watch the show!

I slept on the mattress for a month straight to give my body time to adjust to it. I was still waking up to a stiff back and shoulders. The mattress has barely any give to it; it's like laying on an oversized firm couch cushion. I would say it would have maybe 1"" of ""sink"" to it before hitting the dense support layer. It didn't support the arch of my back and it put a lot of pressure on my shoulders as well when I laid on my back. I consulted with customer service, who sent me a mattress foam topper (at $20 shipping cost) so the top would feel softer. I gave it an honest try but the mattress is still way too firm to even enjoy it. I contacted customer support and asked them to pick up the mattress. I am now sleeping on a cheap futon that I bought for my living room, and I'm getting the same quality of sleep as I did with the Casper.

And once you lie on it, your muscles seem to relax slowly into the mattressmattress, as if they were being massaged in slowly. Your body relaxes into the mattress and it feels wonderful!: back, side, even lying on our stomachs, which we never do, was extremely comfortable. We have had the mattress now for approximately 5 weeks and every time we get done it is it refreshing reminder of what a great purchase we made. Mind you, I was very apprehensive about buying a mattress sight unseen and untested, but felt safe with the hundred day guarantee. The company gives you 100 days to decide on the mattress but it only took us one night to realize it was not leaving the house without a fight!! I I would highly recommend this mattress to anyone. I have major back problems and they are fine when sleeping on this mattress. I'm so glad I ordered it. Hopefully, the mattress will not develop a memory for our body shapes as this is our only concern, but onlytime will tell. Great job Casper! and thank you...

I've tried different mattresses in the past, to include a Tempurpedic which was way more expensive and I returned after only 3 weeks as it was hurting both me and my wife, and this mattress is totally different.  I was somewhat skeptical of buying a mattress without physically trying it first, but I must say the blind date was a great match.

The mattress is very comfortable, not too soft, not too firm, and so far my wife and I haven't had any pains or aches, and seem to sleep well through the night.  One thing potential owners should take to heart is the company's recommendation of having a very flat/solid foundation for this mattress as it truly makes a huge difference.  You will truly enjoy this mattress if it lays completely flat, and with solid support underneath.  

As we all know there is nothing completely perfect in life, and I must say that the mattress is not designed for people to sit at the edge for extended periods of time, but in all reality... how long are you going to sit at the edge?

We have had a pillow-top for the past 5 years, but have been wanting a new mattress for awhile now as the pillow-top was getting uncomfortable and ""deformed"". My husband and I both tend to like a bit more cushion than a firm mattress has to offer, but with all the hype around the Casper (and the no-brainer guarantee), we figured we'd at least try it out. We were quite pleased with the ""cushy"", super-soft top layer. There is more of a firmness to the under layers than we are used to; however, we have been sticking it out for a bit more than a month now ... wanting it to be ""the"" mattress. I am fine with it, but do agree with my husband that for a side-sleeper (like he is), there is just not the best give. I have slept on my back AND on my side in this mattress and have to agree with other reviewers that it is definitely more comfortable for a back-sleeper. Actually a *very* nice sleep for a back-sleeper!

The other thing is the coolness factor. Wow. I am naturally cold-natured, my husband hot-natured ... and we both shiver a bit under the covers until body heat warms us up. We usually sleep with the thermostat on 68 because my husband gets so warm at night. He ended up changing the temperature to 70 now, which is truly amazing for him!

A few nights ago, he just wanted to try our pillow-top again because he was wanting more cushion. Well we slept AWFULLY that night. Seriously. I went to bed and immediately thought, ""Good grief, it's hot!"" Two hours later I woke up, uncomfortable, and HOT. Ugh. For me to be hot is just crazy. I couldn't stand it though. I went into the living room and ended up laying the Casper down on the floor and sleeping on it the rest of the night. That morning my husband said he slept terribly too, so we put the Casper back on the bed.

We then checked out the website and found their claim that a medium firmness was really best for all people to be realistic, and with the 100 night in home trial and promise of a no hassle return too much to dismiss. After 3 months myself and my wife and our dog wouldn't sell this bed back to Casper for a profit. Tasha's long battle with tensed and pinched muscles and nerves is done and I've never been more comfortable. This bed answered our prayers for a fraction of the cost of other memory foam beds.

4714,2016-02-10,Michael Anderson and K...,40.0,Eagle River, Wisconsin,1,Extreme Pain by 3 A.M.,"Do not buy this bed.  I admit, it is my fault I am stuck with this bed.  I am around 20 days beyond my trial period.  However, in my defense, every time I called to return the bed the customer service representative gave me something else to try to fix the discomfort issue.  I really did not want to return it because it was easy to unpack and it seems like it should be comfortable.  Plus, who really wants to return a bed?  Word of warning, do not make the same mistake I made.  Return it as soon as you begin to think that it is not right for you.  Do not let them talk you into trying to make it work for you.

Here is a real example of the advice the customer service department gave me to rectify my problem.  This is an actual cut and past of the chat conversation I had with customer service.  

""If you are willing to move the mattress to the floor, and send us images of the base, the indentations (maybe with some weights on it) and of the law tag with the manufacturing date, we can work something out once our product team reviews them""

Again just return the bed do not hesitate.

Issue #1, it causes extreme pain in my back after about five hours of sleep.  I called and they sent me a topper to ""provide more comfort""  free of charge.  It worked for a week.  However, the pain came back.  Then customer service told me the surface below the bed was not hard enough.  I ordered new bed boards.  Pain was gone for a few nights then it started to come back gradually.  Within a week the pain was back to being unbearable.  My wife has the same issues with the bed.  However, her pain is not as severe as mine, so I get the couch and she is stuck in the bed.  Yes the couch is more comfortable.

Issue #2, there are permanent indents where my wife and I sleep.  I am not small but not huge either.  My wife is much smaller then I am.  I weigh about 200 lbs., and I am 5'10"" tall.  So the fact that there is a permanent  indent from our sleeping on the mattress tells me there is a flaw in the design.

We decided to try the Casper mattress for 100 days after it was mentioned on a website comparing mattresses. Imagine our surprise that we could find a mattress that was both latex and memory foam so cheaply and on top of that get a 100 day trial to try it out before finally deciding. Despite the fact that I had slept on a very firm bed and my husband was used to a lush, plush mattress, we both LOVED our Casper beds the longer we slept on them. I kept track on a calendar when we reached 30 days, 60 days and then 90 days when we FINALLY decided we were definitely keeping them AND buying a few more for our guest bedroom.

I only have two minor criticisms.

One, the zipper seems a bit flimsy. It's only an issue if you have to move the mattress around. When I moved the mattress from one room to another, the tension on the fabric caused the zipper to open. I thought it had broken, but luckily it zipped back up correctly.

Two, the foam is slightly uneven on one end of my mattress - it looks like the top layer was cut a few inches too short.  It's not visible when the bed is made, and you typically don't use the extreme edge of the bed anyway (head/foot in this case, not side to side), so I decided not to worry about it.  But thought you might want to know.  If it had been the side edge, I probably would have asked to exchange it.

Sleeping on my Casper is an absolute pleasure. I did not realize how well I could sleep, until sleeping on my Casper. I previously had a nice, very comfortable pillow top mattress. The initial feeling of lying on the Capser does not give the same sense of ""soft and cozy"". However, that ceased to matter for me once I started sleeping harder than I can ever remember. Additionally, my daughter still tells me she misses the old mattress, because it was, ""so much better for jumping."" Too bad for her, because I absolutely love getting into bed at night. It's hard for me to image a better experience. 

To go along with my new Casper, I also bought new sheets at the time. While is all worked out fine, I was nervous about if the sheets would fit. At the time it didn't seem as though the FAQ was very explicit on your website about sheets indicated for larger mattresses also fitting my Casper just fine.

It's like buying a car, where the salesman is always trying to up sell you and all you want is a comfortable bed. How hard is that? Since I live in NYC, I was able to stop by the Casper office to try out the bed. No one was trying to convince me to buy it. It was the exact shopping experience I wanted.

I ordered online, and the bed was delivered a few days later. Unboxing was super easy, since they provided a tool to cut open the plastic, and the bed just opened up and boom, ready to go. At first I thought the bed was a little firm, but after 2-3 weeks, I got used to it and I've had great sleep ever since. So much so, that I bought another one for my parents house. Now when I visit, I get to sleep on exactly the same bed with the same firmness, so it just feels like I'm back in my own place.

4825,2016-02-03,Heath,34.0,Omaha, Nebraska,5,9 Months of Awesome Rest!,"My wife and I bought a conventional spring mattress in early 2013. It cost $1,200. Within a year it had lost all support. I weigh 200 lbs. My wife 140 lbs. We found ourselves increasingly pressing against each other in the night. The middle of the bed sunk. Shifting uncomfortably, night-after-night we would wake up. Poor sleep was impacting our days. It was time to shop.

Mattress shopping is a nightmare. We visited the typical shops. The salespeople had no real knowledge of how mattresses are made, material choice, longevity, the impact of different body weights, how they hold up for intimacy, etc. Then I turned to the internet. I spent a few weeks researching online. I sorted through the fluff, which there's plenty of, and came across Leesa and Casper.

We ordered a Casper after deliberating for a few days. The deciding factor was the top layer materialDunlop Foam. I'd learned a lot about different types of foam, manufacturing processes, and the real-world performance in my research. The Leesa employs upside down, egg-crate style, Avena foam for their top layer. We preferred the natural latex foam (hypo-allergenic, anti-bacterial, and anti-dust mite qualities) to the synthetic Avena foam. Another strong consideration was firmness. The Casper is a notch firmer than the Leesa on a scale of 1-10. My spouse and I wanted a firmer bed for intimacy.

We have been absolutely delighted with the Casper mattress! Both my wife and I love it for all the right reasons... fantastic support in the right areas while sleeping, doesn't get to hot, the aforementioned natural foam qualities, responsive support, and it's held up like it's still brand new.

Finally, the price is amazing! The Casper was $400 cheaper than the mattress we bought just two years earlier. I hope Casper keeps doing what they're doing, because they're doing it right.

I have chronic pain due to some serious medical conditions and because of that pain I have chronic insomnia as well - while my Casper has not made that all go away - it makes me comfortable enough to get a good night's sleep on most days.

I started cancer treatments early 2015 which put me in bed more than usual. (Now, mind you, the mattress I was sleeping on is 16 years old). As soon as I started sleeping on my Casper mattress (12/24/15, my Christmas present to myself), the back pain began to disappear.  I am, for the most part, back pain free. I still have minimal back pain, only because of low back/core weakness from the cancer treatments. Which will be alleviated as I gain more strength.

 This mattress has greatly  improved my quality of sleep. One of my cancer treatments has caused me to go in to early menopause. If you are a woman that has experienced menopausal hot flashes/sweating, you can understand what I mean. This mattress has helped my sleep, even with the hot flashes. 

 I love this mattress so much, the ONLY thing I hate about it...... Having to get out of it!

And I am glad I stuck it out.  With having chronic lower back pain for the past 20 years I would experience all kinds of body aches, numbness in my legs, tossing and turning and feeling like a zombie in the morning due to lack of real sleep.

36 days in on testing out the new mattress I was not convinced this was the perfect mattress for me. I still found it hard to get comfortable on my sides.  Having the L5 vertebrae issue makes it so I need to change positions several times a night or else I get really achy.  I spoke with Casper and they sent me the mattress topper, which was excellent quality by the way.  Casper customer service was very helpful in getting this to us. 

It has made a total difference for me in adding in just a little bit more softness and cushion, especially for side sleeping.  

My only complaint is the mattress does sleep warmer so I just wear lighter pajamas to bed so I dont sweat.

We also ordered the Casper pillows as we found that with the mattress being on the firmer side our cushy pillows werent doing the job with proper neck support.  The pillows have also made a huge difference in the way we sleep.

With the mix of this mattress and seeing a physical therapist I can honestly say my 24/7 back pain is almost gone.  I havent been this comfortable in 20 years.  Sometimes I find Ive only tossed and turned 2-3 times in the night as opposed to 10-12+.

For the record I am 55 135 lbs. and my husband is 64 205 lbs., he has always thought the mattress was more comfortable than me without the additional padding.  With his weight I think he could sink in more.  With the both of us laying on the mattress it doesnt sink in the middle like a traditional spring mattress and I dont find myself rolling to the center which is amazing.

I had a sleep number bed before my Casper and I initially thought that since I was paying SO much for my bed it had to be good, right?

It wasn't until my fit bit started to track my sleep patterns that I realized I only spent about 3 hours a night in a restful sleep pattern.  Something had to give.  I began researching mattresses.  Nothing really caught my attention until I saw the Casper commercial, cute commercial, right? I was skeptical. How could a mattress that cost so little, compared to other mattresses, be any good.  My mattress arrived on 1/22/16.  It was so simple to set up, and I haven't had hip pain since then.  My fit bit now tells me I sleep 8 sound hours a night.

If I didn't, I would have given it one or two stars. It's been exactly a month and I can say that my body's getting used to it more and more.

This bed arrived right before Xmas. It was a gift to myself because I messed up my back really badly and decided to just charge it. What the hell. I was sleeping on a thick futon mattress but...it was still a futon mattress.

Anyway, when I first got on the bed, it felt wondrous. Really. I looked forward to sleeping on it that night. 

Unfortunately, my back was killing me from sleeping on it...This was a different pain than the pain I was already suffering from. I couldn't sleep on it. I even slept on my actual futon a couple nights after that too.

To me, it felt too soft. At the time it didn't feel like it was supporting my back and when I went to sleep on my stomach, I felt like I was arching my back too much. When I slept on my side, it didn't feel like I was sleeping straight on my side. 

I was in pain and was really wondering how I might have to return the mattress.

Then I slept on it on top of my comforter and it felt much better. I did that for a number of days. I seemed to be sleeping better and better on it.

When I'd wake up, I'd just sit with a heating pad for an hour or two before going to work and I'd feel better. That was another week.

Now I don't need the heating pad and I sleep pretty well. I still have to figure out what pillows I need to get so that I can sit up and watch stuff on my laptop from the bed. For some reason that's still uncomfortable.

All in all, though. I'm happy I bought it. If I feel this much better after 30 days, I'm sure I'll feel great about it once I hit the 100days mark.

Shipping: UPS had to cancel and rescheduled our delivery (we ordered around the holidays), but we received our mattress, albeit a few days late.

Set up: Make sure you have a dolly or someone who can lift a large, heavy box if you need to move this thing more than a few feet from your door. Open the box, slip off the plastic cover and bam, your mattress is ready to go within minutes.

Surface: Finding an adequate surface for our Casper was the most stressful and annoying part of the process. If you're resting your mattress on the floor or a flat surface, you'll be fine.  However, we needed a foundation (boxspring) for our bed frame. We couldn't find a foundation that didn't have gaps larger than 3"".  We almost returned the mattress, but ended up ordering a foundation from Amazon and adding extra slats and nailing those in.  The extra slats are slightly higher than the slats that came with the foundation, which is annoying, but once the mattress is on top of the foundation you can't tell it's uneven. If Casper can create a foundation for their mattress, I would buy it in an instant and bump up my rating from 4 to 5 stars.

Although some people might feel like $850 dollars ($800 with referral discount) is a lot to spend on a mattress, after sleeping on it for about two weeks, I can certainly say it is worth every penny.  The Casper Mattress is, bar none, the best mattress I have ever slept on.  It is the perfect mix of softness and firmness.  From the second you take it out of the box, you can tell Casper spent a lot of time and effort on their design, as the mattress feels a lot more expensive than it actually is.  Having the top layer of the mattress be latex, a second layer be memory foam, and the last layer be a foundation foam, is a huge improvement over a strictly memory foam constructed bed.  In every memory foam bed I have laid in, I have sunk in and felt smothered (I am 6'1"" and 180 pounds).  In the Casper mattress, I barely sunk in at all and it really felt perfect the first night I slept on it.  Within the first week, I definitely noticed and improvement in my sleeping patter, as I did not constantly wake up in the middle of the night tossing and turning.  Also, I've never been one to have a TV in the bedroom, but, honestly, the Casper Mattress is so darn comfortable, I don't want to get out of it!!

I'm an average female, 5'7/150# and my husband is 5'10 with average build and weight as well. We've been using a SleepNumber bed for 7 years and, regardless of how many times I changed the setting and whatever ""number"" I chose, I ALWAYS woke up with stiff muscles from my neck through my hips. I kept the setting on 90-100 and my husband used 25-35. Needless to say, our bed was completely lopsided which made being close a challenge   In fact, I used to love traveling for work just so I could get a good nights sleep on some hotel bed. 

 My husband heard about Casper on one of his geek podcasts so we decided to research it online. Given the reviews, the incredibly affordable price, ease and exediency of shipping and no cost / no hassle returns ... we ordered one that same day.  We figured it couldn't be any worse than the glorified air mattress we'd been sleeping on all these years!

But the longer we sat on it (we like to sit in bed at night and read) and now after having slept on it, we realized it was perfect for both of us.

5009,2016-01-14,Michael Shockley,35.0,Sacramento, California,3,Too firm,"I would not recommend this mattress to a friend ... yet. While I've been getting used to the difference of a foam mattress vs. a pillow-top, I share this mattress with my wife, who is a side sleeper. She is doing her best to give it a break-in period, but she has not slept well since we got the mattress, even leaving one night to go sleep in our guest room. It's just too firm for her preferred side-sleeping position.

We bought this mattress because my father recommended it. However, since then I've learned that he was sent a foam topper for his mattress from Casper, which has made the difference in him keeping the mattress vs. sending it back.

I understand that Casper is reluctant sometimes to send out this topper to those who request it, but after discussing it with my wife this morning, she's reached the point where she'd like to give it a try. If that's not a possibility, then her vote is to send the mattress back.

Please let me know how we can receive the foam topper that may help make the difference in us keeping the mattress.

My boyfriend is a stomach-sleeper and absolutely loves the mattress. It is firm, keeps us cool, and unlike other foam mattresses we don't spend the night slowly tipping on a slant towards the middle. If it were exclusively up to him we would keep it.

Unfortunately, I have pretty horrendous lower back problems, and this mattress is just a bit too firm for me. When I sleep on my side (as many other reviews state), my shoulder is in a mildly uncomfortable position. When I sleep on my back, I don't get quite the support I need and I end up feeling achey. I do love how it feels when sleeping on my stomach, but unfortunately this has to be minimal due to the aforementioned back problems.

Overall, I would highly recommend, particularly to those who like a firm mattress. It is surprisingly squishy in just the right way.

5057,2016-01-11,Nicole and Eric + Kitty,32.0,Tustin, California,5,Maybe one size really does fit all,"Received our Casper mattress and was a little thrown off by the packaging and unboxing of the mattress. The husband was pretty skeptical and couldn't believe that our new mattress that we paid almost $1K for was rolled up like NASA cargo and came without a boxspring. We unpacked the mattress (which was pretty entertaining to watch) and let it air out in the guest bedroom for a few days as it does have that manufacture/chemical smell to it. Laid on it for a few minutes to ""test"" it out since they don't have showrooms and it seemed comfortable enough. TempurPedic like support with more bounce is how I would describe it. Before we set it up in our master bedroom and during the airing out process, I had also ordered a wooden based box spring from a local mattress company. It works beautifully with the mattress and I didn't have to spend time assembling it which is what you will end up doing if you order a platform or box spring online. Total investment for a new bed = $1K. Still 1/3 of the price for a TempurPedic which is what we've really had our eye on for the last few years. The first few nights on the Casper I thought were fantastic, my husband was still getting used to the firmness but he also wasn't complaining about his quality of sleep. I prefer a more medium-firm mattress and he prefers medium-soft; this mattress is definitely on the more medium-firm side. I did notice that my body had very slight aches in the morning (I don't move around much in my sleep and generally favor my left side) but the aching and soreness was significantly less than from our old Stearns and Foster mattress with pillow top that we paid about $1,600 for.  The old mattress gave me shoulder pain and a stiff neck to the point I would have to take medication and ice it down to alleviate the inflammation. After the first couple of weeks of sleeping on the Casper I slept like a baby and noticed I was sleeping more on my back side (supposedly it's better to sleep on your back than on your side to avoid stiff muscles and joints). As a result I haven't woken up with any pain or stiffness in my left shoulder or neck. My husband has also become a raving fan and we both noticed that we are sleeping in more on the weekends. This mattress is a great compromise in cost without losing quality. It doesn't sleep hot like most people complain about with TempurPedic and that was a concern for me initially with this mattress because I burn like a furnace in my sleep. Investing in some quality sheets and a mattress cover will address the issue of getting too hot for those of you that have this same concern. We've been telling everyone about our Casper mattress and have noticed more advertising for it as of recently. This mattress may not be for everyone but my husband and I both love it and I'm pretty confident the majority of folks who end up with this mattress will appreciate it as much as we do. We are both extremely satisfied with the quality of our sleep and still have about 50 days of our 100 day trial left. We will be keeping this mattress and I am very pleased that my husband is finally sleeping in more on the weekends and when he does get up earlier than I do, I can't even tell he's getting out of bed. We both wake up feeling refreshed without pain but the one downside is that it has been harder to get out of bed in the mornings; it's that comfortable. If you are considering a new mattress I think Casper is well worth looking into and is a more than reasonable investment for a good night's sleep.",8,Sleeps with a partner plus a cat,738,False,True,False,True,False

We had been in the market for a new mattress for a while, but had been hesitant on pulling a 10 year trigger after 30-45 seconds of lying on showroom-floor mattresses.  When Josh and Chuck from Stuff You Should Know mentioned your product and its generous 100 day trial timeframe, we threw caution to the wind and opted for a trial.  The first impressive thing about the Casper mattress is the package it comes in.  I wish there was a way to open it twice :)  The second impressive thing is the smell - or lack thereof.  I opened the package in the basement, fully expecting to let the foam air out for a week or two before sleeping on it.  THERE IS NO SMELL.

It appeared, and still appears, to be a quality made product.  It felt firm from the start, but we thought it might need breaking in or that our bodies would adjust to it.  Turns out it was less comfortable than just about any mattress we had previously owned.  We added a topper that Casper kindly recommended and provided (nice customer service).  But that did not improve our sleep experience.  We still wake in with aches, pains, and numbness like never before. I contacted Casper for any recommendations or solutions. I guess it was too late for any sort of return/refund and they did not have any additional suggestions (other than to suggest purchasing their pillow to see if that helped...no thanks).  Nearly one year in and we are ready to give up on the Casper mattress.  We're trying to sell it and go back to traditional coil spring mattress unless we get lucky with some sort of additional topper that makes the mattress bearable.",8,Sleeps with a partner,751,False,True,False,False,False

A product/service has to either really blow me away or be horrible for me to give a review. I'll also give a little background about myself and why I decided to give Casper a try. I first want to say I heard about your product through ESPN radio's Dan Lebatard, which I'm reluctant to listen to, but that's a whole other subject. I heard him many times gleam about his Casper mattress and how it was so amazing and such a luxury product. So one day out of curiosity because I figured that the price was way out of my price range, decided to look it up. Found out that a lot of people have tried this product that have RA and that it has done really well for them. I don't have RA but I do have AS (Ankylosing Spondylitis) which is a condition like RA but it moves up my back fusing verts together. Needless to say it doesn't feel that great even with medicine and regular exercise. I wasn't really in the market for a new mattress but after speaking with my fiance we decided to give it a try. Well lets just say this mattress far surpassed any kind of notions I had and even the many reviews I feel do not do this product justice. My back feels absolutely amazing!!! I wake up without issue and I'm able to spring from my bed (which doesn't have springs ;) ) This product has changed my life in such a short period of time. I'm well within my 100 days and I have already made my decision to keep this mattress. Not only am I sleeping better by my fiance is as well. We both enjoy much deeper sleeps and don't wake each other when we get out of bed for work in the mornings. So thank you Casper for developing such an amazing product and I wish you much success in the future.",7,Sleeps with a partner plus a cat,751,False,True,False,True,False

After tons of research, I decided to pull the trigger on Casper, and I'm glad that I did.

This is simply the best bed I've ever had, period.  It took about a week for me to get used to it, but once I did, I don't think I could ever sleep anywhere else as comfortably again.  I travel for work and to see friends, so I stay in a few hotels, mostly with traditional coil mattresses.  NOTHING comes close.  I've always tossed-and-turned a lot in my sleep, but the support and give this mattress has even helps to make it so that, despite the unconscious gymnastics, I don't wake up.

As for, shall we say, ""conscious gymnastics"" in bed, while nothing will beat those spring mattresses, the construction of the Casper is pretty damn close.  The bounce and lack of ""sinking"" into the foam is minimal compared to other similar mattresses.  On this note, I've had several overnight guests stay with me, and all have commented on how amazing Casper is to sleep on.  I've already convinced one friend to take the plunge on it (after he and his family did similar research), and I will happily endorse this mattress to anyone and everyone.

If you go to a bed store, there are many types of brands, softness/hardness, height, and etc. This company just have one mattress that fits most of the people's needs. Of course Casper is going to run in to an unsatisfied customer. You just can't make everyone happy but I can guarantee you that they are doing an excellent job satisfying hundreds, if not thousands of people in the US and the neighboring countries. 

The website is so easy to navigate. Big buttons, limited selections, easy to understand details about the products they sell. The naming of the product itself is something to smile about. It's a pretty cute name to say the least. I am sure that young open minded people with a lot of meetings and lack of sleep (Contrary of what they are selling...LOL)  brought this simple idea for the success they are having.

Now for the bed, I was unfortunate to have a Flu-like symptoms on the 1st day of the sleep. I woke up with pains all over my body but that was not due to the mattress. It was due to my Flu.

It took sleeping on other mattresses for a week here and there, then coming back to my Casper, for me to truly realize how much of an impact the mattress was having on relieving my chronic pain. I don't dread traveling now (though I do travel frequently), though you will find me Tweeting about how much I miss my Casper while I'm gone.

I ordered my Casper after moving from Georgia to Oregon, and didn't want to add getting a mattress on top of the already stressful move. Casper made it super easy, and they even gave me free 2-day shipping so I would have it before Christmas. When it turned out they couldn't get it to me before Christmas, they gave me a $25 refund back to my card. It's the unneccessary friendly business like that that will keep them regarded as a strong company. Great customer service is hard to find these days, but not with Casper.

I've only slept on it for one night but oh my gosh-I've never slept better in my life. It is the perfect amount of firmness, and you can feel it molding to your body the longer you lay on it.

Beauty-rest that had literally collapsed leaving both of us with worse than the bad backs we started each night with. Casper is amazing, and we would without a doubt recommend Casper to all. I almost took a picture to send you of our 4 dogs on the old mattress with a slanderous caption; Beauty-Rest has gone to the Dogs! We can now see that there is a reason that the ""Other Guy's"" don't offer a 100 day money back guarantee on their products.

I've had tempurpedic, innerspring, generic memory foam and latex mattresses. Hubby and I are very tall and weigh more than the average shorter person, so we go through mattresses every year or two. Latex was the first material that worked well for us and didn't break down after a year. We moved to Hawaii recently and had a Serta iCloud memory foam mattress come wth our house, and we thought we'd tough it out as our living arrangements are temporary. Well, after a few months of awful sleep quality, we decided to try Casper. The materials intrigued me and the price was half what we paid for our latex set (still in our other house). Great return policy, so why not? SO glad we did! My sleep app has my sleep quality now at 98-100%, where I averaged 60-70% on the old mattress. It's very comfortable in all positions, and I'm typically on my side or back. It seems firm, but has just the right amount of give, so nothing ever goes numb. Hubby loves the Casper, too! He likes it even more than the latex we had previously, though time will tell for me. I'm dubious that the Casper will hold up to long-term tall people doing typical nocturnal things. But we'll see! I added the Casper pillows as well, and those suckers are PERFECT. I have quite the collection of pillows from my quest for that perfect fit for my sleep positions. Down, memory foam, gel, buckwheat, latex, wool, shredded latex, shredded memory foam. Nothing is as good as the Casper. Nothing. I hope Casper stays in business forever simply for this pillow! We will be ordering many more for our family and guests. They're better than the pillows at the Intercontinental (and I loved those so much that I tracked them down and bought some).

    I ordered my mattress a few weeks after I got home and within a few days, that gloriously clunky box was sitting on my porch waiting to be torn open.  Opening the plastic and watching it unfurl like a glorious welcome mat for my body, I KNEW my life was about to change for the better.
   My first night sleep was beyond restful....it was heavenly.  I was immediately comfortable and felt no pressure points, just sweet, subtle support.  I have slept blissfully the last several weeks and will sing the Casper praises to anyone who will listen.

5448,2015-12-23,Marshall Garrison,52.0,Cincinnati, Ohio,4,"Very good, in-line with expectations, comfy, one faq discrepancy","I tend to write long reviews, so, here's a summary.  For in-depth commentary, read on.

Pluses:  A superior sleeping experience of comfort & support, and anything comparable is substantially more expensive - the Casper is a bargain for what it offers vs. others such as Tempurpedic, Sleep-Number, etc.

Negative: Initial odor/fumes take longer to dissipate than stated in the FAQ; might be a problem for sensitive noses.  My take - it's worth the wait.

Neutral:  Mattress in  a box delivered to your door, so you don't have to go shop in a store, and have strangers in your house delivering a new mattress.  However, you have to deal with disposition of your old mattress yourself, whereas, typically, dealing with a store means they have a mover setting up a new mattress and taking the old.

More:

If you're coming off a conventional mattress, you'll almost assuredly find the Casper a substantial step-up in comfort.  I've been on a 3"" Tempur mattress-topper & medium-firm mattress for years.  The mattress-topper helped relieve pressure-point tossing & turning (not thick enough to eliminate it), but at 18 yrs. of age, it's gotten broken-in, and has lost some of its original support & resilience in recent years (so, generally, a 15yr. lifespan).  The downside of Tempurpedic memory foam is how hot it sleeps - for me, in summer, the a/c has had to be cranked low to compensate for body-heat buildup & containment, and winter, thermostat set to 58-60.  Comparatively, the Casper's latex foam sleeps much cooler, which is more comfortable, regardless of season.

The Casper has a good mix between comfort & support.  Brand new, it's slightly firmer than what I've been used to, but it's been a very comfortable sleep, without much noticeable tossing or turning from pressure points.  Compared to",7,Sleeps solo plus a cat,782,False,False,True,True,False

The first night on my Casper was different - I definitely tossed and turned while trying to find a position to fall asleep in, as it really is an adjustment from the inner spring and pillow top mattresses I've gotten accustomed to over the years. As someone who's worked retail for over 20 years, I've just recently woken up with a stiff next here and there, coupled with very occasional back pain and some Sciatica. Well, the next day after my first night on the Casper, I had significant back pain throughout the day. Now, I did my homework on this mattress, and I know that there is an ""adjustment"" period (they say about 2 weeks), so I obviously wasn't going to throw in the towel just yet

Well, tonight will be my 12th night on my Casper and I LOVE it!!! No more back pain, Sciatica, neck pain, nothing. I cannot wait to get into my bed and just relax.

I had purchased it at Nebraska Furniture Mart and the sales guy had told me the variance was 1/4 inch if it started to deform.  Well, apparently, he lied and we tried multiple times to have it replaced (it caved in the middle) and they refused.  So. . .Three of my peers (we are all sales managers) told me about their experience with Casper.  The business model was very similar to our company when it started, so I was intrigued.  They mentioned the quality, the cost of entry and the service (gee, all BONUS).  After looking at the cray-cray priced Sleep Numbers, my wife and I decided we would likely try it.  We purchased a new, sleek low-profile Italian bed/platform and I needed to know the clearance for the mattress.  I dialed the Casper phone number and, lo and behold, a real human answered my call and was most helpful.  I ordered the mattress, it came and the handwritten notes were really a nice touch.  Over a month has gone by and we did end up getting the 2' pillow-topper in yesterday because my wife likes it a little more ""fluffy"".  Problem solved.

My husband loves the great back support. My cat loves to sleep on the bed with or without us, too. He sleeps on the Casper more than he slept on the traditional mattress.
The worst part of the mattress is having to get up in the morning. After the adjustment period, this is the most comfortable bed we've ever slept on.

The mattress was delivered during a rain storm and the box was soaked, so I had to unbox the mattress downstairs and take it up to the bedroom in just its compressive plastic wrap. The hardest part of that was getting it up a flight of stairs alone as it is a heavy, dense thing. 
Then it sat in the corner for three days until our new bedframe arrived. We had no problem with the wrap weakening while it sat in the corner, and the experience of unwrapping it was every bit as fun as was promised.

If I had to return it (hopefully not), I have no idea how I'd put it back in the box. I am used to firm foam mattresses, so the softer top on this one took me a few days to get used to. Initially I had some lower back pain, but I think that my spine alignment is better on the Casper than on my previous mattress, and I simply wasn't used to that. After about 10 days the pain was gone. I sleep as well as I did before, but the mattress is so comfortable that it's sometimes difficult to get out of the bed in the morning. ;) One disadvantage is that the mattress sleeps quite hot - I've removed my comforter and I'm still sweating at night. I'll give it another month or so to finally decide if it's for me or not, although I'm leaning towards keeping it. A huge plus was the price, obviously (I refuse to believe that mattresses that cost twice as much or more are somehow better) and the super fast delivery. I also like the marketing scheme and the amount of e-mails etc. (no spam, just helpful and timely information). I did not care that I could not try out the mattress in a store.

And recently, I developed some severe allergies. One of the recommendations from my doctor was to change out my bedding. I started with sheets and such and as my mattress was getting close to 10 years old and I could feel a sag in the middle, I started contemplating Casper as a purchase in the new year with my tax return. I found the research and technology they put into it very intriguing. I read how it works best on a platform bed, which I didn't know anything about. So the research began and I found an incredible deal for one so I jumped on it, then ordered my Casper. The unboxing is an amazing experience and I loved the personal touch of the hand-written note.

My first night was pretty restless, I won't lie. But really that's to be expected. But night two on, I've had a great night sleep. It is somehow so supportive yet super soft. (I've been a little warm but I think it's because of the 30 degree above normal temps we are having.) I can tell I'm tossing about less, and even though I typically sleep on my side curled up around a body pillow, I'm finding being flat on my back to be incredibly comfortable! My cat absolutely loves it too, I can tell. I usually find her on my couch when I come home, but now she's been on the bed. Ha!

I wanted a mattress cover for my allergy situation, so I texted support at Casper and they recommended me a Luna mattress encasement that can block the dust mites and all that. It sleeps very quiet and adds minimal layer. Text support is a great, convenient service!

After the first night, my wife wasn't comfortable, but I was. Casper advices sleeping on it for a few nights to adapt, but my wife was having trouble -- it was just a little too firm for her liking.. Long story short, we ordered a soft topper from Casper (very reasonable price) and that next night was bliss. No turning back.

After a couple of months, here's what I've noticed: fewer middle-of-the-night adjustments to change position (used to find myself shifting from left to right side  6 to 8 times a night -- now, maybe once or twice); no disturbance when my wife (or dog) shifts position; sleeping at least an hour longer each night; and feeling much more refreshed with zero stiff muscles, unlike our previous mattress.

Un-boxing the mattress was fantastic. There was no smell as stated in other review, no nothing, except for a mattress in perfect shape. 

The mattress itself: We wanted to love this mattress, I mean we REALLY wanted to! The mattress was just far too firm for us. We reached out to Casper and for a fee of $20 they sent us a topper to help soften the mattress. We tried to make this change everything but it just didn't happen. We gave it as much time as possible, closing in on the 100 days we finally admitted to ourselves that the pain we were in was not normal and our mattress was to blame. 

We are both side sleepers and have discovered a new understanding of upper back pain. I am in not quite severe, but close, pain. To the point where  it has affected my daily life. We've been sleeping on our new mattress from a big box store for 3 nights now and am starting to see a difference already. I have a massage scheduled in 4 days so I'm hoping she'll get my back somewhat back to normal. 

If Casper came out with softer model I know we would be willing to give them another try. It's too bad there is only the one firmness level as a mattress is definitely not a ""one fits all"" product.

I was offered a free mattress topper to try and help with the firmness but my bed is already so high that my mattress can't exceed 10"" or I'd need a step stool and a running start to get into bed.

I am short, my husband is quite tall, and we really wanted a bed that would minimize movement, was firm (since I have intermittent low back pain) and moderate temperatures nicely.

The ordering experience was easy and quick. I received email confirmations shortly afterward and the first attempted delivery by UPS was 4 days later. Unfortunately, my job has crazy hours and I was never home to receive it; by the 2nd attempt I sent a frustrated email to the Casper employees who were super kind, quick and responsive- they orchestrated deliver of one of their showroom mattresses late at night just so we could receive it on time. This was so appreciated and impressive for a company- I was very grateful.

We had no problem unloading the mattress and unwrapping it. It fit our frame like a glove and was not hard to do at all (one person could conceivably unwrap it by him/herself). 

First night was amazing. Minimized movement, maintained a normal temperature, and didn't make my back pain flare. We'll see in the next few months if it improves the pain, but since back pain is more responsive to physical therapy/activity I wouldn't bank on a mattress being able to cure much - the goal is to not make it worse and provide a comfortable sleeping environment.

Unlike the super tall pillow-top mattress we had before in an attempt to get softness with firmness, we don't need a stepladder to get into bed.

Casper has already made sleeping more comfortable, especially for my wife where some of the aches and pains from the other bed disappeared with Casper.  One of the two apparent downsides was the bed was now too firm, but Casper remedied that with an excellent, high-quality topper (which keeps it's shape as well) for the cost of shipping.

As a 230# male with significant history of participating in many sports, I find this mattress comfortable.... but just not that comfortable.  When compared to a local latex mattress, the Casper has less cushion above the layer of latex leaving you on this firm layer without maximizing support by distributing weight along more vectors.  I believe this is compounded by living in a colder Alaska climate leaving the firm latex layer less flexible and more board like (consider this if you live in the northern part of the lower 48).  After 1.5 months I keep waking up wondering why I my body ached.  As a doctor of osteopathic medicine who has been adjusting people for the last 8 years, I would not recommend this mattress to those with osteoarthritis, chronic pain syndromes, history of significant sports participation, and those living in cold climates, and to people who weigh over 200#.

The low rating is only for the mattress, not for the customer service. I would rate the customer service 5 stars, but I assume that people want to know about the mattress.

First, lugging the box upstairs and unboxing it was a piece of cake. Very easy and the mattress was delivered quickly. However, after my husband and I spent our first night on the mattress, we were both underwhelmed. I found the mattress to be extremely hard. Like, dorm mattress hard. I woke up sore for the fist several days after we bought it. My husband did not find it as hard as I did, but he said it was uncomfortable and began having back pain. 

I read that it can take 30 days to adjust to the mattress, so we decided to hang in there in hopes that it would get better. Short story, it did not. I have not had a good night's sleep since we began using the mattress and it has been 9 weeks since we first started using it. I wake up constantly, both for being uncomfortable and also being too hot. I am a person who is always cold, so for me to overheat at night is so unusual. My husband also finds the mattress quite uncomfortable and also has not adjusted to it.

After a few weeks, I did email Casper customer service and they sent a topper in hopes that it would make the mattress softer. It did feel a bit softer for the first couple days, but ultimately, the topper did not increase the comfort. If anything, it detracted from it. Because the topper is not permanently attached to the mattress, it fastens on with elastic that goes around the corners of the mattress like a mattress pad, it shifts and pulls away from the edges of the mattress and actually made a little mountain in the middle in between where my husband and I sleep.

On the plus side, customer service was extremely responsive. They sent the topper and then when I emailed and said that I wanted to return it, they arranged to have it picked up within a week, no questions asked. My mattress was picked up this morning and I immediately received an email saying that my account would be credited with the refund.

Unwrapping and setting up the mattress was really easy, a cutting tool is included to make it even easier.

Still, the smell dissipated fairly quickly (1 night-ish) and was only detected if you stuffed your face into the bed (which is very likely since the bed is so comfortable).

A friend of mine let me borrow a air mattress until I was about to get my own bed set. I come home from work one day and realize that my bed had deflated and somehow a hole was punctured. That night I slept on the floor and woke up several times throughout the night in hip and neck discomfort. Routinely, I watch ESPN at work and caught wind of a 'Casper' ad. ( I never seriously pay attention to ads or follow up with their promotions ) I went to the site, read stellar reviews and saw how easy it was to finance one. Most importantly I saw the 100 day trial and free shipping to me. What separated this experience for me from others was the courier delivery. I saw I could get it the next day and I would only have to sleep on the floor one more night, I went ahead and ordered one. However, the inquirer in me chatted with the very easy and seamless chat tool on the website, which was a great experience ( Thanks again Lauren! ), and asked if I could get my bed delivered that same day although the time slots seemed to be filled. I was elated to find out that the Customer Service rep. rescheduled my delivery for the same day and I could get it by the time I got off of work. The delivery process was convenient and accommodating. I can't believe I bought a bed and in less than 6 hours, without strapping it to a car, had a bed in a box, in my apartment. The unboxing experience was magical and sleeping in the bed had me waking up with a smile. I feel relaxed and got some of the best sleep I have in years. Thank you Casper.

We were just about to spend 3K on another mattress, so we welcomed the challenge of the ""free 100 day trial"" on a bed 1/3 of the price. Ordering, receiving, and opening the mattress was a breeze. However, sleeping on the mattress was a big adjustment for us. Our previous mattress was very soft, so to transition to a mattress with this firmness was not comfortable at first. My husband and I have a lot of joint issues with our backs and necks to begin with, and we would actually wake up in pain after sleeping on the Casper. But after reading reviews and talking to my friend, we knew we needed to give it some time. After a week our bodies started to adjust but it still wasn't quite comfortable enough. By the second week my husband started to like it a lot better, and I was adjusting as well, however I am also 6 months pregnant and it wasn't the level of comfort my body needs right now. I am super sensitive and my joints like to be mean and scream at me when I lay down! So I contacted Casper by chat to see if we can be provided with their topper that they can provide for those that are having a hard time. They highly encourage that you wait at least 4 weeks before they send you a topper as that is their guideline and timeframe to allow your body to get use to it. After I explained I was pregnant and so on, they made an exception and sent us the topper for a $20 shipping/handling fee.  Their customer service is OUTSTANDING! I have had to contact them a couple times and each time, they are friendly and helpful. So, the topper isn't super squishy like a typical memory foam, however, it did help enough to where I can say that I love my mattress now! If I wasn't pregnant, I think I would still prefer the topper for additional support.  We've had our mattress for a couple of months now. But overall I do believe that Casper mattresses are much healthier for your body. Even talking to my chiropractor, he mentioned how memory foam mattresses are not recommended and the firmer ones are better for your health. So please, give Casper a try, be patient, give it time, and I am sure you will love it. There is no risk!

5913,2015-10-31,Kevin and Judy,35.0,Toronto, Ontario,5,100 nights with our Casper bed,"We got our Casper back in July of 2015. We were sleeping on a spring coil mattress prior to owning the Casper. We never owned foam... ever. So the change for us has been night and day. The spring coil gave us backaches, headaches, pain points and if you sit too long in one spot your legs fall asleep. I will say that all of this is gone with the Casper. 

The bed itself is great. Soft yet has enough support. It will even fill/support your lower back (even if you have a big butt). Which is fantastic! Every part of your body is supported. Having said all that... I want to manage expectations and say that everybody is different and your experience may vary. Dont expect that the bed is going to change your outlook on life and do your taxes for you. It's a bed. There are so many other factors why you don't feel rested at night. Could be your pillow, temperature in the room, babies crying, stress, diet, electronic devices... list goes on. Needless to say, a good bed is a key component to your overall sleep quality level. 

Con: The edges around the Casper where someone might sit to put on their socks or shoes is not hard like a coil bed. It sinks in. So if that's an issue for you... This might not work. Being all dense foam its way heavier than traditional spring mattresses so changing the bed sheets becomes a two person job. 

One more thing. If you already have a foam mattress bed then this probably won't impress you that much. Like I said we came from spring coil and that's all we knew. We love it. Oh and it's true when you get it there is a slight smell but it goes away.

I received an offer for an air mattress while I waited for my Casper so I didn't have to sleep on the floor (I still had my old mattress, but the offer was definitely appreciated).

Isabel came back to me and said that they wanted to get the mattress back and they would send me a replacement mattress at no charge (yes a replacement at no charge).  All I had to do was box it up and cover it in a mattress bag that they provided for free and meet the shipping company to give it to them.

I decided to get a new mattress because I was having a lot of restless nights on a cheap firm spring mattress I was using prior.  I was prepared to go all out with an expensive memory foam but decided to start with the Casper because of their return policy.  Figured there wasn't too much of a risk and I could just get it picked up if it was no good.

The bed has always felt very comfortable and unique since using it.  The first couple weeks I experienced some lower back pain upon waking up as my body adjusted to the new bed.  But after that adjustment period, I sleep very easily with no pain at all.

I've consciously compared hotel beds, my girlfriend's bed, and guest room beds anytime I've had to sleep on them.  And none of them are as comfortable as the Casper.  I always get a better night sleep when I can sleep on this mattress.

My girlfriend was resistant to admitting the Casper is comfortable, because I would annoy her by bragging about how amazing my mattress was and how all that research I did paid off.  But reluctantly, even she has finally admitted she likes my mattress better than hers.

I live in CA and don't have A/C in my apartment so I was worried about it sleeping hot.  But that hasn't been an issue.

I would think most people would find this mattress very comfortable and worth the price.  I don't see how you wouldn't at least try it out with how easy everything is in terms of shipping and returning.

5983,2015-10-23,Susan M Nappi,44.0,Middlebury, Connecticut,5,"Casper, where have you been my whole life?","This is going to be a long review but if you're like me, you're going to read it because you're considering buying a mattress in a box and are questioning your sanity. A bit about me: I am a mom who works full-time outside the home, I have two kids,  and a long commute.  I also use a standing desk at work (share this because my back is usually engaged most of the day). 

Like many of us, I'm uber tired. I began coveting king-sized comfy beds during business trips. I'd dream of a spacious sleep space that didn't bounce me awake when my husband needed to get up out of bed (I'm a light sleeper).  I am also a researcher by trade so I started reading up on all the brands of beds I'd slept on at nice hotels (this went on for the last couple of years).  The sticker shock kept me from purchasing - I just kept putting it off because, frankly, being a mom with two kids makes it less likely that I will plunk down 2-3K on a new bed.  I was also totally convinced that there had to be another option. 

Enter Casper. I gotta tell you, the Casper team thought through their marketing campaign because while listening to podcasts and NPR, I must have heard the short and sweet ad over a dozen times. The 20 second spot didn't annoy me and I was lulled into learning more via the trusted voice of Ira Glass. I was also intrigued and to be honest, felt like I was in on something innovative (I know, I know, it's just a mattress). So, trusting that I could send it back if I totally hated it, I used the code on This American Life for $50 bucks off and took the plunge. The Casper team sent me a tracking number and I linked up to UPS so I could start counting down the days until my Casper arrived.  During this process, there was a problem with the UPS truck and I was promptly notified and given a $25 credit for my troubles (very nice customer service but honestly, I had waited years for this - a few more days wasn't going to kill me). Ten days to the day I ordered (on a holiday weekend) it came to our doorstep in a box that was surprisingly compact. 

My husband set it up while I was at work. The whole process (which included setting up a platform bedframe) took an hour or so.  The feel is what others describe - firm yet comfortable. Honestly, the perfect give to a mattress. I was thrilled (and a bit relieved). I slept the best I'd slept in a long time and didn't feel my husband get out of bed that night. 

Of course there are going to be people who don't like this product - every body is different. I suspect, however, that this will suit the majority of people just fine. Yes, there is a 'risk' to buying something sight unseen but Casper has factored that into their money-back strategy and pick-up service. 

I don't work for Casper and I don't know anyone in the company (although they seem like cool people to hang out with) but I am impressed with their customer service and overall strategy. They focus on the quality of the product and reduce overall costs. I don't know their company mantra, but I think it may be:  do one thing and do it well. I hope they don't change this.

Other reasons that supported my decision to buy a Casper: 

- The materials are high-tech and there is clearly attention to detail and allergens. 
- It is made in the USA. 
- Totally convenient and truly risk-free.

It got better over time, however after a month, my back was still hurting too much. I contacted customer service (who are great, by the way!), and they provided an additional layer of latex foam for a nominal cost.  Using this foam has improved my sleep experience, however my back is still achy when I wake up (especially if I get to sleep in).  Perhaps it is because I need to sink into it a bit more due to my size, I don't know.  Anyway, overall, I think  this is a nice mattress, and my wife certainly enjoys it.

As a chiropractor, patients constantly ask me for my recommendation on the perfect mattress. Before Casper, I was recommending hybrid foam and pocketed coils to provide both support and comfort. Now that I've personally experienced Casper, my top recommendation goes to this mattress. The latex top provides the perfect bounce and comfort to cushion pressure points while the memory foam is firm enough to provide adequate support for proper spinal alignment.  This level of comfort and support is comparable to other high quality mattresses but for a fraction of the cost.

6025,2015-10-18,Judith Andrews,31.0,Alexandria, Virginia,5,Let me gush about my mattress,"Disclaimer- I love my Casper and they did not pay me anything to say that. My old mattress had been done for about the last year, but I was dragging my heels on buying a new mattress because I was scared of the expensive commitment for today's high-rated mattresses. I've had lower back problems for a while now and my physical therapist told me getting a new mattress would help make a difference and boy, does it! I was sleeping on a coil mattress from Ikea (the high-end of Ikea mattresses), but it was 7 years old. My Ikea was such a great deal, I couldn't bring myself to buy a new mattress until a friend told me they had heard about Casper and I read the no frills, no hassle, return policy. I am so glad I bought my Casper. Also, you should know that Consumer Reports rated the Casper just as high as the TempurPedic. 

After unpacking my Casper, I could not wait to lay on it. I let it air out for about 4 hours before I put the sheets on and the funny smell was mostly all gone by then.  I've had it for almost a month now and the break-in period for me was only 3 days. For me 'break-in' meant waking up in the middle of the night and a little discomfort at my hips in the AM. Even so, I am excited to go to bed every night. I also haven't had any experience with that 'sleeping warm' thing. I sleep with an electric blanket and I'm still turning it on every night. 

Personally, I would prefer to sleep on my stomach all the time, but my physical therapist broke me of that 'bad for your back' habit. I generally now sleep on my side or on my back. It means keeping three pillows, so thank goodness I sleep alone. There's the one pillow with a higher gusset for side-sleeping, one that is flatter for back sleeping, and one for between my legs when I'm on my side or under my knees when on my back. The only upgrade I might need to make now is to a foam pillow for side sleeping. 

Have I mentioned that I am excited to go to bed every night? I love my Casper.

The UPS person hesitantly agreed to bring it into our bedroom. Opening was easy, but there was no blue dot, or blue line as indicated in the directions as to where to start. When the mattress comes out of the box it is easier to handle, as the weight of it spreads out in dimension. We've slept on it for a month now and really like it. My wife loves it in every way, but it seems to me to be so firm and smooth there is no 'cuddly' texture feedback that I like. The main negative is the total lack of proper sheet sizes available: the need is 10"" pockets, and cannnot find any less than 16"". We called Casper and was told ""check IKEA or LLBean.""  IKEA's are the right size but less than 200 thread count.  LLBean does not have the 10"" size. A third reference you suggested had them at a very high price.

I've been trying hard to enjoy it, but I've come to a breaking point and here are some of the issues I've experienced. 1) not my biggest concern, but they work with UPS for mattress delivery, which I have had terrible experience with. The day I worked from home to receive the mattress, UPS sent a message saying they had tried to deliver (they lied - I was home all day and they did not) and I had to chase the driver down and pick up the mattress in my car b/c I couldn't afford to stay at home another day. UPS generally treats their employees like shit and I don't think any company should use them.
2) I've been experiencing a lot of back pain since sleeping on the Casper, which I never normally experience. Before the Casper I slept like the dead and now I have been sleeping horribly, getting up in middle of night, etc. My husband has been sleeping fine, so that is the reason I have two stars instead of one, but my lack of sleep has really been affecting my waking hours.
3) I am concerned about my having a possible allergy to the mattress. I had a period of strange health symptoms around the time we got the new mattress (hives, achiness, extreme fatigue, trouble breathing, throat tightness/soreness) and am now better after a treatment of steroids and antibiotics (doctors never diagnosed problem), but still not my normal self.

Let me just say it absolutely rocks!! Its a blast to unwrap like everyone says but seriously, it's the simplest concept.  It's nothing exceptional to look at or lay on at first because it doesn't have all the bells and whistles.  That's why it blows my mind how much we BOTH LOVE sleeping on it, it's freaking amazing!

Some of you may want to know what a Casper bed""feels"" like.  Well, let me tell you. You definitely won't have to worry about sinking into your mattress and having your back go concave if you roll to your stomach.  This thing stays nice and firm.  You also probably won't find anything like this at the store.  If you did, it could be compared to the firmest bed there, with a bouncy surface.  But I wouldn't call it soft.  More like a stack of yoga mats.  If you sleep on your side, you may get a sore shoulder, hip or even a stiff neck because it really doesn't contour.  Basically if you want a supportive mattress that doesn't sink, but with a softer layer on top, in my opinion, this is not it.  I am really disappointed because it's such a cool bed. They told us on a scale of 1-10, it is about a 7 in firmness.  Casper does have a pilot program that offers mattress toppers for people who feel the Casper is too hard. The downfall is that you have to give it a month before they will send you it.  I am not sure I will make it that long.  I am almost tempted to just pull out my old mattress.  So before you buy based on reviews saying most ""comfortable"" bed ever, keep in mind what your own idea of comfortable is.

This mattress was ridiculously simple to get out of the box, and unlike other memory foam mattresses that I've had shipped to me, it didn't need hours to expand and didn't smell like death!  Once you pop it open, you just put it on your bed, and then you can even lay on it. Shocking!

The only slight issue I found with this mattress actually came from my cat. Because I was switching from a softer mattress to more of a medium firmness level, my cat decided that she would only sleep on me instead of the bed. After being annoyed with that for 2 weeks, I threw on the old feather mattress topper and EVERYONE is happier!

I'm a runner who crawls out of bed at 5AM before work every day to pound the chilly pavements, and before this bed, I was stiff and extremely sore every morning. Lately, I've popped out of bed easily and I'm thankful that I had it while training for my 10K. I've had SERIOUS back problems in the past, and it could often be exacerbated by laying in bed, but the Casper only seems to help!

This is more $ than I usually spend on stuff like this, but I have to say that it is totally worth it! I hope the other cheapskates out there like myself take the risk! My only suggestion is that Casper be more open about when things will be shipped (I ordered mine while they were still saying that it would be there speedily, but they were quickly backordered!), and not charge our cards until the mattress is shipped!

6158,2015-09-28,Summer Edwards,38.0,St. Augustine, Florida,3,Husband Still Adjusting,"My husband and I have been sleeping on the Casper for about a month; this is my second review of the mattress.  Initially, the mattress took some getting used to (by ME) since my previous was a pillow top (very soft) mattress, but I can pretty much fall asleep anywhere once my head hits a pillow.  I will say, however, that when I wake, my legs are not achy like they used to be.  My husband, on the other hand, has had a much more difficult time. I consistently hear about how bad he slept (although he isn't necessarily blaming the mattress), but he mocks me and says he's ""still adjusting.""  Honestly, he has never been a good sleeper anyway! 
I contacted Customer Service with my concerns and to inquire about the return process (in the event I need to) and was pleasantly surprised to learn of a foam mattress pad offered by Casper.  Once I received it, I added it to the mattress and my husband seems to think it has actually helped; it offers a little more softness.  Apparently ""Papa Bear"" needs plush support !  He surely wakes up with less growl these days.
We have sleeping with the foam mattress pad for about a week and I will continue to decide whether we will keep the Casper...but, if nothing else, I can say Customer Service has been STELLAR with this company.  I could not be more impressed with the prompt responses I have received and their readiness to please.  Way to go Casper!",8,Sleeps with a partner,857,False,True,False,False,False

My husband and I both feel we sleep better with minimal or no waking up through the night. That was not the case with our previous mattress that was less than 4 years old and expensive. 
This mattress is much firmer then previous mattresses we've owned. We both like firm, so this was a good choice. My husbands snoring seems to have lessened unless I'm just sleeping so much better that I don't hear him.  Another plus is we have noticed much less all over stiffness upon waking like we both experienced with our former mattress.
I will say this mattress seems to hold the body heat that neither of us is crazy about. Also after a month of getting used to it I am waking up with lower back pain if I sleep on my back. I'm not sure why that would be and that's a concern.  I'm  hoping I just need a little more adjustment time and the lower back issue will resolve itself. Luckily we still have plenty of time to determine if we made the right choice in a mattress.

We have been sleeping on a waveless mattress for 23+ years, and after breaking most of the baffles, we decide we needed a new mattress.  I do not like shopping, and the thought of having to find a new bed was not a happy one.  So, after looking into the Casper and reading the various positive reviews and the 100-day money-back guarantee, I decide to purchase the Casper.  I was super excited to get a new mattress, and not having to worry about shopping for a new one.
The mattress came (after a few day delay due to being back-ordered - this was not a problem at all) and was well-packaged and easy to move and unbox.  
However, the after over a month of sleeping on the Casper, we are disappointed.  We both wake up sore each morning.  I usually wake up a little sore no matter what mattress I sleep on, so the Casper seems to work pretty well for me - a back sleeper.  However, according to my wife I do seem to snore more than usual - although this could be because she is not sleeping so well.
You see, she has been a side sleeper for years (if not forever), but she is not able to sleep on her side in the Casper.  Again, she was used to the ""give"" from the waterbed, so we gave it a month to see if her body would adjust to the firmer mattress, with no success.
Reluctantly I am going to get my money back and begin a new search for a new mattress.  I am certainly not upset with Casper, but I am bummed that finding a new mattress was not as easy as I had hoped.",6,Sleeps with a partner,860,False,True,False,False,False

What sold me on it was the 100 night guarantee with free pick up and freight if I was unhappy, AND the fact that I was seriously thinking of spending 3X as much on a ""premium"" brand name mattress as this sells for.

We recently moved back to the Toronto area and it was a perfect opportunity to purchase a new bed.  Unfortunately, there was a bit of a backorder on the Casper so we were forced to sleep on a deflated air mattress for about 2 weeks as we had already discarded our old mattress.

We were so anxious to get the Casper that we went out and purchased a doorbell so that we wouldn't miss the UPS guy.  As soon as the mattress arrived, my wife and I opened it up and got it set up on the bed right away.  We even made the bed with the new sheets etc.

First night, my initial impression was: ""Wow, this sure beats the deflated air mattress!""

Second night, I found the mattress to be a bit too much on the firm side.  My expectations perhaps was that it would feel like I was sleeping on a cloud... and perhaps it also had a lot to do with the fact that for the last 15 years, I had been sleeping on a pillow top mattress.

Regardless that it felt a bit firm, I was still getting the best sleep that I'd had in 15 years.  I wake up with no pain in my back or neck.

Fast forward... it has been a MONTH... and every time I jump into bed, the mattress gets better and better.  It seems that the mattress is conforming to my body.  After a MONTH, I am declaring that this is by far the best mattress I've ever slept on.  LOVE IT!!!

Once ordered, I couldn't wait for it to arrive and open the box.  It took 10 days for delivery, exactly what I was told. It was easy opening up the packaging and even more fun to see it expand to its plush-self.
I must say that since the first night of use, this is the most comfortable bed I've slept on. Previously, I had been waking up, tossing and turning at nights from being so uncomfortable {really sore hips from side sleeping, lower back pain and fussing to find the right position with my pillows.} If I didn't wake up with one of those pains, I had shoulder and neck pain. We had what I called the ""sink hole"" in the middle of our 3 year old mattress. I was constantly trying to not roll down into it. 
I don't buy major items without doing my research. I found it to be true to what the company {and others} say. The Casper mattress is a perfect blend of firmness with a soft 'kush' feel to it. I feel supported but not to the point where it's too hard/firm. It's so wonderfully different than what I've ever slept on. It's like I'm being cuddled by the soft while being supported at the same time. This is what it should be like.  I wasn't really worried about an odor or that it would cause a 'too hot' for sleep problem. Based on the reviews I read (hundreds of them) I can confirm there were no issues. I also did my homework and read what this Spring's Consumer Reports said about them; rating Casper very high. 
Basically, I'm so so so pleased with the purchase of our Casper. {Which, by the way, you can fully finance with their partner, Affirm, with 0% interest and pay it by monthly installments.}  Along with their trying it out for 3 months with free shipment {to and from, if you decide not to keep it}. Don't pay $2000 for the other brand. There's no reason to rob your bank account. Casper is a Win/Win.

On one side my wife really likes the Casper. On the other side, I am not too impressed. When buying the casper we compared it to the Leesa. My wife and I both agreed on two things: 1. The Leesa feels higher quality, 2. The Casper returns better sleep. So, that's the elevator pitch... Here are the details.

Quality: OK
The Casper seems to be OK on this front. But I am not super confident the materials used will last the 10 years promised. Mainly the top material (which as referenced above helps with motion transfer), is a bit stretchy and porous almost like a soft cotton or fleece. If you take a peak inside at the foam things are also a bit rough around the edges. Lastly the foam itself in my opinion (as an owner of roughly 4 months) does seem to be wearing a bit. There is no visible sagging, but my side of the bed definitely seems less firm that the center of the bed, thus creating a well of sorts. So again, I am not confident this is going to last.

Comfort: Not for everyone
This is where my wife would say 5 and I would say 2. The Casper for my liking is just a bit too stiff for back sleeping. The give from the top few layers just isnt enough to support my lower back, which for me results in a good amount of stiffness in the morning. This is not the case when I travel and sleep on a decent bed at a hotel when traveling. Also, amidst a pretty warm summer on the West Coast the increased heat from a foam mattress becomes a bit more obvious. With Caspers topper on the piece it was way too hot for me and my wife. In summary regarding comfort, I simply havent found the Casper to be better than average In fact its been slightly worse than average for me, while being really good for my wife. Hence, 3 out of 5.

**Motion Transfer: Very Good
I am going to call this out separately, because it was important in our case The Casper does a really good job of isolating movement. The stretchy material on the top of the surface helps with this as long as your sheets have some stretch to them as well.

We were both afraid that we'd sleep too hot on a memory foam mattress, but that hasn't been a problem at all, and no initial chemical off-gassing smell. They seem to have worked out all of the normal issues people have with memory foam. The mattress is a little firmer than I'd prefer, but it's comfortable enough that I can fall asleep and wake up without any pain. It hasn't done anything for my husband's back pain, though, so we did debate returning it and trying something else. I'm considering getting a foam topper to make it a little softer.

6256,2015-09-14,Austin,27.0,New York, New York,5,"Loved everything about the process, just not the right mattress for us.","I have been having back pain for a while now on my old spring mattress. When I started the investigation into a new mattress, the last thing I wanted to do was go to a mattress store and be practically forced into buying a mattress on the spot. I did some research and found Casper. I read every single review there was online and still had no idea if I was going to like this mattress. Some people said it was too hard, some people said it was too soft, some people loved it and some people did not. I figured I had nothing to lose with the free 100 day trial and the one thing that was consistent across customers was the customer service Casper provided. I love supporting businesses that care about their customers so I decided to try the Casper out. 

The purchasing and opening of the mattress was seamless. It was delivered to our door within hours (we live in NYC).  We opened it up and my first thought was it was so hard, like sleeping on a rock. I was super worried but I did read that it takes sometimes weeks to get used to a new mattress. My boyfriend is not a picky sleeper at all and even he thought it was too hard. We gave it 70 days and didn't feel any better. My back still hurt and it was painful to sleep on my side all night.  We ended up ordering a new mattress and returned Casper. Unfortunately I was not aware that there was a topper they will provide at no cost to make the mattress softer and had already purchased another bed at that point so I was not able to try it. There were a few hiccups in the pickup of the mattress but overall pretty seamless. 

I gave Casper 5 stars because the customer service was exceptional. I work often and do not have a lot of time to call in during the day so I live chatted their customer service team often. Everyone was super helpful and polite. Even though there were a few hiccups in the process, I never felt worried and someone was always there to help out. I would still recommend this mattress to friends if they like a firmer mattress. Interestingly enough, when they came to pick up the mattress they asked if it was too soft. I said no way, too hard. They said that most people complain it's too soft which I don't understand but I guess everyone is different!

The Casper is quite good, but not great  I'm going to try a box spring in hopes it will help the Casper yield at the hips sufficiently. I'd rate it above average. 3.5 stars to 4 stars out-of-five. A good mattress, but the $850.00 price point, while reasonable, is debatable given the competition. Not great if you have lower back or hip problems. There are better out there for that.

Both nights, I just drifted away to sleep, and both mornings, it was so incredibly hard to get out of bed. Didn't sweat at night, either. I actually look forward to going to bed now.

I'm used to memory foam mattresses, and have slept in both really cheap and really expensive ones. The Casper blows all the other ones out of the water. And it's so much better than the spring mattress I was sleeping on before I got this bad boy.

My fianc was skeptical, but is now fully convinced. She has back problems, and this is the first time in years she's woken up without aches and pain. The dog seems to love lounging around on it, too.

Unboxing was a sight to behold. The bed really does expand before your eyes, and the fact that they ship it to you is just so cool. My only complaint is that there's no weekend delivery. Since I work all week, it's hard to coordinate being home to sign for the package (I actually had to go pick it up at the UPS facility - and if you've ever had to do that, you know how much of a pain it is).

I'm also very impressed with Casper's business model. Simplify things, make good mattresses affordable, assemble them domestically, and ship for free. That 100 night return window also removes all risk, and it's very awesome of them to offer that, even though I doubt I'll be taking advantage of that now!

I had just moved in to my new apartment and ordered my mattress to coincide with my move-in date.  Well- no luck.  Casper did send me an air mattress free of charge to sleep on until that time- which was a nice touch! The delivery went awry and the carrier didn't apparently know where Newport Beach was- so Casper offered to reimburse me for the price of a new air mattress.  This was the best customer service I'd experienced from a company in as long as I could remember.  

THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER.

The Unboxing was about as perfect as one of those can go.  There was no odor to speak of (the air mattress smelled worse than the Casper Mattress, if that is any indication).

The bed was initially really comfortable. It was firmer than my 15 year old, $2000 inner spring mattress I am still occasionally using in another room (at this point, just about anything is going to be firmer than that, truthfully).  I noticed that I toss and turn a little bit more, but the problems I usually have with my arm and shoulder while sleeping seem to be less noticeable.  WIN!

After a month I noticed that I started to develop something I'd never had before- lower back pain.  

Now, I'm 5'10, 250lbs, 50"" chest and 40"" waist of a fire-hydrant of a man. I've had aches and pains just about everywhere from working out, rock climbing, cycling, etc.  But I've never had lower back pain.  After really paying attention to how I sleep and how I'm laying, I am realizing that as much as I want to LOVE this bed, I need something that conforms more to my body while I'm laying on my side; something that lets my hip sink in a bit more.

I am sad that I will have to return it.  I know they offer a mattress topper, but my thought is that if I need a mattress topper for a new mattress, it's already the wrong mattress.  I wish they had a mattress that was just a little more pliant. I'd be all over it (literally).

6311,2015-08-30,Melanie Hong,29.0,New York, New York,1,Disappointing showroom experience,"Disclosure- The rating is based on our experience in the showroom and subsequent decision to not purchase the mattress. 

When my husband and I learned about Casper, we had seen the ads posted on the subway and were optimistic/ excited at the prospect/ promise of buying an affordable and straightforward mattress which didn't require us to dive into the overwhelming and confusing world of traditional mattresses. We are lucky to live in NYC that we were able to visit the showroom and try the bed before deciding on the purchase. In the weeks leading to our visit, we had done enough research to know the general specs of the Casper mattress in comparison to their main competitors like Tuft and Needle or Loom and Leaf. However, we were having difficultly discerning between these different mattress as they all seemed relatively comparable based on online reviews. Our expectations for the visit to the showroom were: a) try the mattress; and b) speak to a Rep who could provide us with knowledgeable insight on WHY Casper was different and the right choice for us. Casper was on the top of our list. 

The showroom was set-up as a modern urban apartment with couches to sit on, a seemingly functional kitchen, dining table with iPads/ laptops (to later make your purchase), and two ""bedrooms"". This set-up attempted to elicit the feel of a real apartment, a contrast to the sterile decor of traditional stores that are filled with rows of endless mattresses. 

We were greeted by two young 20 something, hipster looking staff members who asked us to sign in on iPads. The Rep indicated that our wait time to try a bed was about 15 minutes and in the meantime she played host by offering us a choice of drinks ranging from beers to flavored water served from galvanized drink dispensers. We declined the drinks and the Rep asked us whether we had any questions while we waited our turn. I began by asking how Casper compared to Tuft and Needle (T&N), the competitor brand sold on Amazon which we were deciding between. The Rep was honest (to a fault) and told us that she knew nothing about the T&N brand and instead redirected us by parroting back the general specs of the Casper, easily found on their website and clearly memorized from ""trainings."" I asked her what her personal experience was with the Casper brand. She went on to disclose that she still sleeps on a mattress purchased by her parents and did not own a Casper herself. This immediately gave us a bad impression. I followed-up by asking  the Rep to compare Casper to more popular brands like Tempurpedic. Again, the Rep gave us a generic answer pointing to the commonly known fact that traditional memory foams run hotter than their latex top layer. Not helpful. Needless to say, this Rep was unable to give us any new or useful information that we did not already know from their website or our research. 

After waiting a few minutes, we were ushered into the ""bedroom,"" given supposedly new pillows, and the opportunity to test the bed in our privacy with the door partially closed. We laid flat and on our sides. The overall feel of the bed is that of memory foam with some sinkage when you lay on your back. When you shift to the side, it feels firm like a traditional mattress. We also felt that the first layer gave it somewhat of a hollow and bouncy feel. 

Given the Rep's inability to effectively provide us with any useful information, we left just as confused as when we entered the showroom. We understand that one of the allures of Casper is the ease and simplicity in the purchasing experience. However, this should not take away from the fact their Reps should be professionals who are knowledgeable in their products, especially in how it compares to their competitors, and should have more general knowledge about mattresses! In the end, we were still left confused/ overwhelmed with the process- not knowing whether 3 or 2 layers of materials was superior, or provided with any real data points to compare other similarly constructed mattresses. As a consumer, I felt insulted by the lack of professional customer service and how they hid behind the smoke and mirror tactics of a ""hip"" staff, fancy decorated apartment, and complimentary drinks in order to sell us a mattress. 

Even though Casper tries to differentiate its purchasing experience from traditional mattress stores like Sleepy's, at least Sleepy's ""mattress professionals"" try to help consumers to make an educated purchase by providing thoughtful answers to our questions based on actual industry experience.

Ultimately, we decided this wasn't the mattress for us in large part due to our experience at the showroom coupled with the fact that it didn't truly meet our comfort expectations regardless of the enticing price and ease of purchase.",7,Sleeps with a partner plus a cat,872,False,True,False,True,False

They were super helpful and offered to pay for an air mattress to bridge the gap for us which we accepted and bumped our order to VIP status and the mattress ended up arriving just about when we moved in.

On my old mattress it took me forever to get to sleep and I would wake up several times a night to reposition myself trying to get comfortable, so would my dog (a 5 lb Italian Greyhound).  Between the two of us shifting around all night, a good night's sleep was few and far between. I sleep SO soundly on my Casper mattress. I guess my dog does too, or maybe he still gets up and moves around and I don't notice anymore. Either way, I wake up feeling refreshed every morning and don't get warn out halfway through the day. Shipping, unboxing and customer service were all great.

Things to consider...Like I said, it traps heat. If you get hot easily this mattress might not be for you. This mattress is kind of in between soft and firm. I personally think it leans more towards the soft side though. The firmness is perfect for my tastes, but I know that might not be for everyone, so if you like a really form or really soft mattress, this mattress might not be right for you. So if you like a really firm or really soft mattress, again, this mattress might not be right for you. Same if you have back problems.

Background: Six years ago we bought expensive mattresses to put on our convertible beds.  The beds could elevate, vibrate, make wave motions, and each side had independent air controls to adjust the firmness under a memory foam layer.  They were the best beds we could find when we got them.

A check valve on my wife's side sprung a slow leak, so her mattress would deflate overnight.  She'd end up waking in the middle of the night to run the pump to fill it up again.  The check valve could not be replaced, so we were faced with getting a new pump unit (the old one wasn't made anymore) and new remote controllers for the new air pump.  This was going to cost about as much as a new Casper.  

As this was going on, I was having trouble sleeping also.  Often I'd wake totally drenched in sweat as the memory foam below me caused me to bake in my sleep.  My side of the bed was inflated to be softer than my wife's and I sunk deep into the foam.  I'd flip from my side to my stomach in the night and wake up early, wet with sore shoulders.  I was sleeping fewer than six hours per night, and often having to grab short naps during the day as fatigue overtook me.

I would recommend you unpack the mattress 5 or 6 hours before you plan on sleeping on it, due to a very minor odor from the ""degassing,"" but other than that there are no issues whatsoever.  The odor dissipates very quickly, within an hour or so.  The rest of the time is to make sure the bed is completely flat on its surface, letting the mattress settle essentially.   This is just a precautionary measure I took, not necessarily instructions from Casper.
I think my 5 hours' sleep just got bumped up to 8.  The first night on the mattress was the best sleep I've had in a very long time.  I would say, if you're super sensitive to temperature, that it does sleep slightly warmer than ""cool,"" but honestly it's not really noticeable unless you're nitpicking it like I was.  I live in the desert, and it was 117 degrees the day it was delivered, so that had quite a bit to do with the temperature of the bed I'm pretty sure.   Also, there have been a few reviews on other websites saying if you've never had a memory foam mattress, it might take a bit to get used to the support.  In my opinion, you get used to it within seconds of first laying on it.  It's dramatically better than an inner spring mattress, which I've been sleeping on for 28 years now (not the same mattress, mind you).
Overall, well worth the investment, and I would strongly suggest taking a look at this mattress.

Clearly Casper is catered entirely towards aesthetic and convenience rather than comfort or price. Have these people all been sleeping on rocks for their entire lives? Like yeah, the subway ad looks cool, but that's not a reason to invest $600-$1,000 into literally the most important piece of furniture in your home. 

This mattress is so soft, it has basically no support. I haven't been able to sleep at all since I got this thing three months ago. I've been trying to return it for weeks, but their customer service is so inconsistent and unreliable (not to mention their promise of a 1-hour window carrier service is complete bullshit) that I can't get them to take it back.

The only reason I got this thing in the first place is because I was in a rush to move into the city to stop commuting from the suburbs, and my job was so time-intensive that I didn't have time to look for a real mattress; they promised easy and quick delivery (which was a lie). It took them two attempts to even get me the mattress. First they said they would drop it off on a specific day during a specific time window, but I then found out (when no one came to drop it off that day or the day after) that they sent it in the mail. It never arrived. I had to call them and FINALLY they sent a courier (who needed a four-hour time window to deliver--not one). I didn't have a bed for a week and a half when they were supposed to deliver it on the day that I moved in.

I know it is advised to give it a couple of weeks to get used to, but it felt soooooo good last night, I can't imagine it can get better. It's such an improvement from our prior mattress. 

We had watched the videos about unboxing the mattress, so we were ready for the great unfurling. It was really simple. The hardest part of the preparation was just getting the box upstairs (we're both old and arthritic, so we literally lassoed the box and pulled it upstairs). 

Our prior mattress was a 9 year old Sleep Number bed with a 4"" memory foam topper. My husband's controller had long since died and mine never seemed to be right. No matter the adjustments, we couldn't stay comfortable. The topper was hot. Then there was that hard foam divider between the two air chambers.  And the sides were always collapsing.

We did keep the SN base to use with our new Casper. It's a perfect platform.

Now, we have cool comfort that supports where we need support and is soft where we need give. And it doesn't feel like we are in separate beds. We woke up happy this morning after the best sleep we have had in years.  Not once did I wake up during the night with hip, back, or neck pain, which I had been doing with our old mattress.

Great price for an amazing mattress that has already relieved my chronic back pain in just a few weeks.  But the customer service is where I want to focus, I ordered this mattress at the end of July knowing that it would be 7 - 10 days before the mattress even shipped because of the demand but didn't expect it to be the max number of days before it shipped.  I brought my concerns to the online chat service and was asked what I was sleeping on in the meantime.  When I told them I was crashing on my couch (I'm in the military and didn't ship an old mattress to my new station just to have my new one bought and delivered soon after) they were not about to let that happen and proceeded to order me an air mattress from Amazon and had it to me in two days at no charge to me!!!  I checked it out and the Air Mattress was a 70 dollar air mattress and they just gave it to me because they cared that I was stuck on a couch while waiting on their mattress.  What gets even better is that they send a personalized handwritten note with the mattress when they send it, how do I know its personalized and not a copy and paste fill in the blank with a name type form?  They mentioned how they were happy to get me off of the air mattress and hinted at other things we had discussed in our customer service conversations.  I don't know about you but the customer service alone has made me a lifetime customer, next bed I buy will be a Casper and as long as they exist I will only buy Casper mattresses.

1. quality
The quality of the mattress, the finish and the materials is superb. I was really impressed. It even looks good. The feeling when lying on it is impressive - it feels fairly opulent.

2. customer support
The customer support was sensationally good. I contacted them about it being too firm and they helped me out with an experimental topper. Even then I couldn't get fully comfortable so I returned it. The support people were hugely helpful, never judgmental and always pleasant and friendly. I was seriously impressed. It must cost them a fortune to be so nice to customers...

I have pretty serious lower lumbar issues, so finding a bed over the years has proved difficult, but with the reviews I read and even word of mouth, I decided to try Casper.

My wife and I went to the NYC showroom and as I've stated, the staff was excellent. We were taken to a private bedroom and instructed to take as much time as we needed to test out the mattress. We stayed for about 20 minutes before deciding to purchase the mattress.

Skeptical because who orders an untested mattress online. Relieved because mattress shopping is really actually the worst thing ever and because I'm the person who takes an hour to make a decision off a 5 option menu at a hot dog stand. Another words, no options = good options. 
So now to the reviewing...
Customer Service: I had trouble with the delivery because it wasn't going to arrive within the time frame I requested. I had asked them to make a note that I needed it to be held at the UPS hub but the note wasn't recorded. I called, and was rather huffy (sorry), but they handled it wonderfully. They called UPS and made sure that they held it and where very quick about it. I haven't had to call since ( see mattress review below) but the little that I did need them they were professional and helpful.
Mattress Review: I've always had trouble sleeping. Used to have insomnia and also major back issues. I've never had a mattress I was in love with, and I've had some really bad ones. I am so pleased to report that this mattress is genuinely what I hoped it would be. Firm and also quality= the recipe for a good night's sleep. It's as simple as that. If you are looking for something your going to sink five feet into this isn't the mattress for you, however the top layer of foam gives just enough cushion to make it conform to your body in the right places. At the same time, the high tech middle and bottom fancy layers make for tremendous back support. The only note I will make is that I try not to favor one side of the bed over the other as it seems that I already have broken one side in a little more. Still the bounce back is amazing.

Shipping: Shipped quickly and as promised. I had a little problem when I selected a change of address. I had confirmation that it was going to be shipped to the new address but it didn't.  Thankfully a neighbor was home. 

Packaging: Easy setup; my bed was set up in minutes. 

I was actually quite shocked with how nice the mattress looked. The material on the side gave it a really nice touch, the top of the mattress was nice and soft. Overall quality was more than I was expecting! 

It did sit really low, so it reminded me a lot of a piece of college furniture.  That was a little disappointing.

My body is like a furnace at night and I was nervous about all the reviews saying it was a hot mattress. I didn't seem to notice that at all.

It just didn't do it for me....
Anytime I got into bed or knelt on it to make it, I just sunk in. The only time it stayed nice and firm was when I was completely flat on my back and directly in the middle. I'm a side sleeper and I didn't feel like it supported my hips enough. 
I like to sit up and read or watch TV in bed and if I was sitting up, I would sag a bit.

I liked the firmness, slept comfortably, and awoke without any aches or pains, however beginning right around the 6 month mark I started waking up with stiffness in my lower back, which got progressively worse as the months went by.  It is now month 8 and I am ready to toss the Casper on the side of the road. 

I wake up every morning with severe low back pain & stiffness, which takes me a couple hours to work out. By lunchtime my back feels normal again, but I now dread going to bed. The firmness of the mattress seems to be deteriorating from use, which I understand, but surely that should take years and not months. This is not some back situation, as I am active & healthy and don't have any back problems...until I sleep on the Casper. Once I'm up and about for the day the pain and stiffness goes away, so I can confidently point to the mattress as the source of my troubles.

Bottom line? We no longer wake up sore, stiff and in pain. It was firmer than what I had expected, and I was very skeptical... but proof was there in the morning.

We travel for a living and our ""RV"" requires a special sized mattress. We were so convinced by our ""in home trial"" of 3 days, we went ahead and had it cut and recovered to fit our RV bed frame (thus voiding the warranty). That's how much better this thing sleeps - we aren't worried about the warranty.

When I got there, they said they were sorry but they didn't.  Nice.  They talked me into a Serta memory foam mattress, saying it was identical to the tempurpedic.  I've been waking up with back pain ever since.  

I saw an ad for Casper in my local paper and decided to give it a try.  Why not?  100 day no questions asked return policy for a mattress?   I am beyond glad that I did.  The first time I laid down on it I could tell it was a life changer.  Much firmer than my Serta.  I don't sag into it.  Sleeps much cooler than the Serta as well.   NO MORE BACK PAIN!  I was really skeptical that a mattress that comes in a box could be the thing I was looking for.  It was and I'm beyond happy that I tried it.

I was also worried about not liking the product and figuring out how to box it back up and send it back to them.  No worries there either.  Apparently they will send a courier to pick it up and donate to a charity somewhere.  I don't see that happening.  This mattress is a keeper.  

I don't know why, if you were looking for a mattress, you wouldn't try a Casper.  They aren't expensive.  Delivered to your door.  You get 100 days to try it.

We had been sleeping on a combo Latex foam/Spring mattress with pillow top.

6549,2015-07-30,Betty Barratt,55.0,Terrebonne, Oregon,5,Best Mattress Ever for my bad back,"My husband and I unboxed this mattress right on our platform bed. It was easy peasy. 
We have our old mattress leaning up against the wall in the garage in case we didn't like this one within the 100 day trial and needed it. Well, in just a few days, the 100 day trial will be over and we can haul that old mattress off.

First let me say, I have Fibromyalgia and sleep is a huge issue with people with those of us who have this condition. Pain all over is an issue as well.  I developed Osteoarthritis in the last 5 years and my back has suffered more than I can say.

As we all know, when shopping for a new bed, it is not an easy thing to go through with so much out there to choose from in brick and mortar stores. Been there done that.   Another joy to having Fibromyalgia is fatigue and frankly I just was not up to going through that process again. 

My husband heard about the Casper mattress on a radio program and shared this with me as I was getting interested in another mattress I found online. We decided that we would try out the Casper mattress and if it did not work out, we would try out the other one that also had a generous trial time but was a little more expensive.

Now about the Casper mattress.....    The latex top makes all the difference in the world in my opinion. It moves with you and the memory foam underneath works much better because of it.  I was concerned about the possibility of sleeping hot but turned out, that is not an issue at all. 
Very importantly, I can sleep longer periods at a time without my back bothering me.  I don't expect a cure all but going from 2-3 hours at a time to nearly 7 hours is huge to me. 
This mattress is 4 inches shorter than our old one and as I noted, we have a platform bed, which means no box springs. I prefer a higher bed so my husband used some wood formations and raised this mattress by 3 inches and this works better for me.   

We knew after week one that we were going to keep this mattress, but I felt that it would be better to rate and review it once the 100 day trial was up.

And once that time is up I should call in.  I was VERY surprised to hear that from her.  So at this point I kinda don't really know what to do anymore.

6635,2015-07-22,John R,50.0,Tampa, Florida,3,Quality mattress but not for side sleeper,"Ordering effortless. Delivery a little slow. Setup a breeze. Seemed to be of good quality with a nice appearance. Minimal odor although you'll notice it for a week or more if you sleep on your belly. Sleeping was a problem. Nearly four weeks and my wife and I are sleeping shorter and waking up with shoulder stiffness. Returning mattress and although Salvation Army hasn't picked mattress up yet the company has been very responsive to get it done. They say once I email them pickup receipt they will refund me in three business days. 

Think the mattress would be excellent if you sleep on back or belly but problematic for side sleepers. It's weird. The mattress has a good amount of sink when you sit on it but when you lay down and distribute your weight it is very supportive which is great for back or belly sleepers. The problem with it I believe is the top layer is latex and that layer doesn't have a lot of give unlike the total mattress so you get pressure points on your shoulders as a side sleeper. On my belly and back I like the mattress but hate it on my side. The upside of the latex is that mattress has a nice bounce and sleeps really cool. I had to keep the covers on that I normally kick off. 

Casper offered me a free ""adjustment layer"" but the description of it was unappealing. A topper with four straps for the corners. It didn't sound like something we'd want to deal with so we went with the return. Barring a problem with the refund, Casper has been great to deal with and they've made a good mattress at a great price for most sleepers just not us.

No big deal these things happen. Over a week goes by and I get another email that the mattress shipped and they send a tracking number with it. Heres where the problem starts. I click on the tracking number and UPS site only that a label has been created and thats it. I wait and check back still no progress. On the day Casper said I receive the mattress I call Casper to see why it still shows that way. At that point they tell me that they don't know where the mattress is and that UPS didn't scan it. We are looking into it. It would have been nice if they called or emailed me to explain that to me but they didn't. I was told they would call me with an update. They didn't. I call back the following day and they told me the same story and added that i would have to wait another 4 days before they would do anything because it was UPS fault. They never called back. So I called again 3 days later same story. They never said they would send another mattress out and were reluctant to do so after I suggested it. So I cancelled my order. They chose to lose a customer and create this situation instead of doing the right thing. If I didn't initiate contact to resolve this I most likely still would not have heard from them.

6660,2015-07-20,Anand Ghotge,29.0,Seattle, Washington,2,Good solid mattress but horrible customer care,"This review has two parts to it:

1. The experience of using the mattress: 
Unboxing was very easy. I found it equally easy to setup and place the mattress on my bed frame. I have used the mattress for a few days now and find that I get really good sleep while on it. I primarily sleep on my back and the mattress offers good back support with no ensuing back pain in the morning. My previous mattresses have been firmer coil mattresses so from that perspective this is a bit on the softer side. I'd like to point out that the mattress does get very slightly warm (due to the memory foam) but its marginal and overall this is a good solid mattress to have.

2. The order process and delivery: 
This is where I went through a major problem. I ordered the mattress just prior to the 4th of July weekend (June 30 to be precise) and actually received it on the July 15 due to a production delay. A week later when I called Casper to inquire about the delay I was greeted by a woman who very brusquely told me (and I'm paraphrasing of course) that it was my fault since the website had mentioned ""production delays"" during the order process. I don't remember seeing this but let's assume that such was the case. My order e-mail does not mention any delay, no effort was made to proactively give me a new delivery date or to expedite shipping. It still took 5 business days after the production delay for the mattress to get to me. I had to make alternative sleeping arrangements for that 1 week delay.
Given that the mattress is good but not phenomenal and given the level of service that I received I would be loathe to go through this process again. Next time I'll simply order from a store where I can feel the mattress and everything is communicated clearly.",7,Sleeps solo,907,False,False,True,False,False

6685,2015-07-18,Li Lai,30.0,Chicago, Illinois,2,Too Plush. Disappointing Return Policy.,"I was eager to try Casper due to how inefficient it is to shop for mattresses the traditional way through big-box stores. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed by my Casper experience. 

Receiving it was a cinch. First impression for my boyfriend and I was that it felt  too plush/soft for our tastes, but we gave it a few weeks trial.

Pros: Coils were very independent so there was not a lot of transference when one of us would get up in the middle of the night

Cons: I woke up with a sore back every morning throughout the trial due to how soft the foam was

Eventually the daily, low-level discomfort from sleeping badly made me return the mattress. (My boyfriend slept fine, not any better or worse than usual.)

Returning the mattress was where my experience went downhill. I was EXTREMELY depressed to find out that Casper mattresses don't actually get returned, they just get junked or donated to charity. And Chicago charities don't accept mattresses due to worries about bed bugs.

Casper promises hassle-free returns, but that was not my experience. I had to stay on top of my customer service agent by calling and emailing over the course of 1-2 weeks. I wanted to try and find a charity to take the mattress but to no avail; eventually, 1-800-GOT-JUNK came by to pick it up.

My real issue with Casper: I hate the idea that a company is making it this easy and affordable (well, free) to discard brand-new mattresses on the whims of fickle consumers such as myself. I never would have bought a Casper mattress if I knew it couldn't be returned, only thrown away. I feel incredibly guilty about this whole process and about contributing to consumer waste just because I was too lazy to test out a mattress in a store before buying.

In the end I went to a Sleepy's anyway, spent about an hour testing out different mattresses and spent only $10 more than what I paid for a Casper. I love my new mattress and have slept beautifully on it the last few nights. I suppose that doing it the old-fashioned way is sometimes best.",7,Sleeps with a partner,910,False,True,False,False,False

No, I don't suffer from high blood pressure or menopause yet so that's not the reason behind it.

I told my husband about the 100 nights testing period, told him the mattress is shipped right to our house without the need to go back to a mattress retail store and showed him videos of people unboxing their Casper mattress. We both agreed to try out this mattress since it was clear we had nothing to lose. 
The unboxing experience was really exciting. We had so much fun building up the  suspense of opening the box, carefully cutting the plastic and viola! Watching and listening to the mattress hiss and expand on our box spring was really fun.  
We always slept on a pillowtop mattress and we found we both had to take a few nights to adjust to this mattress. It took us both about a week for our bodies to adjust to the comfort of this mattress. After the first week, we were completely happy with this mattress.
One thing I really love is the light weight of the mattress. The light weight is very noticeable when changing sheets. Our old pillowtop corners were so heavy there were times I needed my husband's help. Now, it is super easy to change our sheets due to the weight and flexibility of the corners of our new Casper mattress.

Worse than the wood-stiff mattress my single father with aspergers bought for my room when I was a kid.

Lying on my back, every part of my body that contacts the mattress heats up so much I have to on a side to minimize surface area with the mattress to cool off.  Because the mattress is soft on surface, but stiff under the memory foam layer, I can't sink comfortably in, to sleep sideways either.  Sleeping on this mattress, as an experience, sits a couple of notches above insomnia.  Why?  Because with insomnia your mind just won't spin down.

6723,2015-07-14,Mike Rametta,24.0,Bronx, New York,4,"Exceptional night's sleep, and 0% financing makes it a must-buy!","I moved into my first NYC apartment about a year ago and inherited a relatively flimsy foam mattress from the previous tenant. Moving was expensive enough, let alone a new mattress! A couple of months ago, I could no longer tolerate it and was getting terrible-quality sleep. I wasn't looking forward to sleeping.

Enter the Casper. While I was a little hesitant about the pricing (having never bought a piece of furniture costing more than $100), the 0% 6-month financing with no money down (and a 1-month lag between approval and first payment) sold me. I wish that Casper would offer the bike delivery to the outer NYC borough of the Bronx, but the UPS delivery worked just fine, as well. I'd recommend having a friend with you to help unbox it. 

It took a couple of nights for me to get used to the mattress (which, as the included booklet says, can be the case if you were sleeping on something sub-optimal). On the third morning, I woke up stunned with how much energy I had and how I did not feel terrible like I usually do when I would wake up on the old mattress. I even forgot to drink my 10:00 am cup of coffee! My old mattress was on the curb that day.

It's clear that the Casper is meticulously made. Some other reviewers compare its feel to ""sleeping on a marshmallow,"" which I would agree with. The latex top layer is indeed springy but also quite supportive. I have also found it quite breathable, which says a lot given that I live in a pre-war apartment with only a window A/C unit of dubious quality. I find myself falling asleep faster in whichever position I find most comfortable. If you're used to memory foam or gel-infused memory foam (into which you sort of sink and settle), you might find this mattress firmer at first. But you'll quickly like the bounciness and ""just-right"" level of support. I used to look forward to sleeping in other beds (hotels, parents' house, etc.), but now, I'm actually a little disappointed when I'm not sleeping at home, now.

The only reason I'm not giving it 5 starts, is because it is a lot firmer than I expected. It is advertised as not too firm, not too soft, but If I had to rate it on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the firmest, id give it an 8. Maybe even 8.5 :(

The entire experience of acquiringThe Casper was phenomenal.  We loved everything about the marketing and philosophy of The Casper, and felt comforted that even if its performance did not measure up to the incredibly attractive company ethos and aesthetic, we had the reassurance of the 100 sleeps guarantee.  We replaced a bespoke spring mattress of 11 years with The Casper, and while it *did* take a few nights to adjust to the new feel of a foam mattress, in less than a week, my husband and I were forever convinced of its superiority.  It really is like a supportive cloud.  We had just grown to assume that intermittent insomnia, overheating, motion disturbance, and stiffness & soreness were part of that whole ""sleeping while aging"" thing. Not so with The Casper.  Husband's constant complaints of back pain disappeared, and we have both been naturally awaking earlier than we did with an alarm, and feeling refreshed rather than groggy in the morning. I cannot recall the last time I have slept so soundly or so thoroughly.  I am happy to report that my 2:30 AM ""To Do Tomorrow (er, Today)"" lists are a thing of my past.  

Of note for Southerners: I am a notoriously hot sleeper, but The Casper has remained cool and comfortable every night, even in this devilishly hot, humid summer; it is also a ""fun fact"" to reside in the state where The Casper's knit textiles and craftsmanship are sourced, and to border the state where the foam and manufacture originate, as I like knowing my slumber is helping support the labor of my neighbors. PurchasingThe Casper literally and ethically helped me sleep at night.

I would hasten to say that we (and our beloved pooch) are a little obsessed with The Casper - maybe even #obsessed.  Or possibly #CasperObsessed, if I can make that a thing.

I knew this was a big deal because I'm only 21 years old and I shouldn't be suffering from back pain already.

The first few nights I slept on my Casper I found myself falling asleep really quickly, and honestly sleeping like I was dead, but when I woke up in the morning my back hurt when I got up; I didn't worry though because they do tell you that you need to give your body time to adjust.

I have been waking up for years with back pain which took a couple hours a day to work out.  
Any who,  my wife and I were looking for a new beds with space aged technology and made with rare earth unobtainium (made up word people) that were thousands of dollars.  There was no shortage of those bad boyzzzz.  Then I stumbled on to a Casper add when my company was researching cutting edge advertising campaigns.  They were brilliant adds, but more importantly they got my attention.
They pushed their sleep guarantee and the price was incredible so I gave it a try.  I have to be candid when I say it took a couple days to get acclimated to the bed because I was so used to my old mattress.  But on that glorious third day I noticed that I woke without back pain.  It had to be an anomaly.  Nope, it's been weeks and it's still feeling great.  
In fact, I am pretty active and tend to push it until my back gets sore. When that happens I stretch out on the ole Casper for a few minutes, sink into that splendiferous (another made up word people) mattress and feel the back  relax and the spine release and get back at it again.  Oh sure, I may accompany that with a couple aspirin or a cocktail on occasion, but I know for a fact that it helps!

I would dearly like this manufacturer to develop a topper for their mattress. I would rather buy one from Casper that is designed specifically for this mattress. I will probably have to put several blankets down to sleep on top o after my operation so I do not soak the bed every time I sleep in it. This will be the mattress that I will use probably for the rest of my life replacing it as I need.

Free delivery to your door could not be simpler. After the first three nights, I started to get concerned after waking up sore. But the guide, along with a handwritten note which is a nice touch, says it could take up to two weeks for your body to adjust to no longer sleeping on springs. And about five days in, my partner and I realized just how amazing this mattress truly is. We could not have asked for a better bed for the both of us. He likes a firmer mattress, but I like it softer. Somehow Casper manages to make us both totally happy. This is a huge improvement over our previous mattress. It's also nice that it does not require a box spring. We used it on the floor for a month before we purchased a new bed. And now it's just as comfortable as it was on the floor as it is using slats along with our new bed frame. In summary, I was nervous after the first few nights on the Casper waking up a bit sore and uncomfortable. But trust me, just give it a few days for your body to adjust and you will NOT regret it. We could not be happier with any other mattress. And the delivery process is amazingly convenient with free shipping.

6866,2015-06-28,Gerardo Garcia,24.0,Garden Grove, California,5,Dern Dude,"Alright, this is my first ever review for a mattress so bare with me here. For starters I am a 24 year old male, 6 foot 2 inches tall and 225 in weight, and my main hobby is gaming.

Unboxing: 4/5
To begin the unboxing was pleasant, it was neat to see the mattress slowly come to life once it was carefully cut out of the plastic, I didn't encounter any problems and the package itself arrived, I think it'd be best if you have a helper but it isn't entirely needed.

Sleeping: 5/5
At first switching from sleeping on a spring mattress all my life to this kind of mattress felt...different, I don't really know how to express it, but the transition was a bit rocky. However that soon changed around a week and a half where I noticed that I was getting used to it, and now that I have I must say the rocky transition was well worth it. I fall asleep faster and don't wake up to toss and turn multiple times like I did before, I just find a comfortable position and off to sleep I go. As a side sleeper I find all the pressure points to be softened. I even wake up feeling much more rested, though I'm not a morning person at all so I'm still a grouch, it can't be helped.

Intimacy: 5/5
I'll do my best to keep this as safe for work as possible, so this may be brief. I am a male who enjoys the company of other males, that being said I have a close friend 'with benefits' as they say. When we get together this mattress has made a difference, it doesn't transfer motion which was new to the both of us, in terms it made us feel more grounded which is a positive, I will not go into more detail about that. In short this mattress will not interrupt intimate moments between you and your partner. 

Issues/gripes:
The only real issue is more probably a personal thing in which the mattress dissipates heat. I have a bad thyroid thanks to genetics and my body often overheats, especially when I sleep. This is something I've had to deal with since I was young, so the idea of a mattress that can 'dissipate heat' sounded a bit too good to be true, since every mattress I've had seemed to be a heat conductor for me. And I found that this mattress both impresses and dissapoints at the same time in terms of heat dissipation. I found that this does dissipate heat, but not as much as I was hoping. However this is just my personal take on it, maybe it helps someone better that doesn't have a thyroid issue, that being said it does get rid of SOME heat for me, way more than any other mattress I've had, so this is primarily just a personal gripe than a real issue, so take it with a grain of salt.

Misc.
I've read reviews of people sinking to the bottom and honestly this is not an issue for me, as stated above I am by no means a small person, and I have a bit of a gut going, so I am quite heavy. But not once have I sunk to the bottom, it has the perfect firmness and holds me up just fine...maybe because I have a wider frame? Or maybe it depends on the surface it lies on? My current bed frame uses wood planks so maybe that has something to do with it, regardless it isn't an issue with me. This has also helped me with my lower back, which I kinda messed up accidentally when trying to lift something that was a little too heavy for me years back, so I can see this mattress being of use to those with back problems.

Conclusion: Get this mattress
Coming from many low quality Ikea mattresses this is a massive improvement in every way I can think of. Its not too soft, not too firm, and very affordable compared to other mattresses. I can without a doubt say this is the best mattress I've ever had, I hope it will continue to do so for years to come. Thank you all who read this review, I hope it helps.",9,Sleeps solo,928,False,False,True,False,False

I have never liked it. It was too firm (I suppose I sink into my dad's mattress because it's more than 20 years old and all the springs are probably broken...), and I woke up every morning stiff and achy. And even the last time I visited my dad, I did notice that although the initial experience on his guest mattress was bliss, I did still wake up in the morning a bit stiff. After a lifetime of horrible mattresses though, I kind of thought that it was somewhat unavoidable though, that stiffness was just part of the morning deal after laying mostly unmoving for 6-8 hours. I was intrigued when I heard about the Casper mattress, but still a bit skeptical when it felt more firm than I was hoping. I decided it was worth a try though, especially after reading all the other good reviews too. I did like it right away, but in the first 2 weeks I was still trying to make up my mind how I felt about it because I still had this idea that I wanted to sink into it more like a cloud. However, after a couple weeks I realized that my back pain and stiffness in the morning were completely gone! For me, it wasn't a revelation right away how amazing this mattress is because it gave me an absence of pain. But this is huge- I used to start every morning with a groan and a big ""Ow"" as I rolled out of bed, and then I would hobble for few minutes like an old person who needs a walker. It would literally sometimes take 30-60sec before I could stand up fully because of how stiff my back was. That hasn't happened once since I got my Casper mattress! I am so happy!!

All of a sudden, about a week ago, I suddenly was able to sleep on the mattress all night rather than having to move to my reclining chair  due to pain.  Apparently it just took me about a month to get totally adjusted to the Casper and now I am absolutely delighted with it.  In fact, this is even more amazing since the Arizona ""monsoon"" season started a few days ago and has put me in even more pain than usual.  If I didn't have the Casper, I would be spending most of the night in the reclining chair.

The heat was wafting up from the mattress. Not a good night of sleep. Night two was much better. Not sure if I was having heat flashes the night before or what. The next 4 days after that the bed got more and more comfy, but don't be fooled: this is dunlop latex and it is just soft enough on top but it remains firm all night long.

I have really enjoyed the switch so far and feel that making the switch to the Casper is great. The difference in choosing to sleep better is just no comparison to any future decision you choose to spend your $900 precious dollars on. Invest in your sleep. It really gives you the sense of mind and satisfaction out of every day you spend. Take time to sleep comfortably and no more descending springingly into the depths of non REM worthy dreamyness. It really gives you the sense that what you have had has been complete utter sh** and you need to step your sleep game up. It's been two weeks so far and I will update this around the 3 month mark, but I don't take back my decision in giving into the Casper. Much respect to these guys who are putting themselves out in the $$ market and creating a product suited to the consumer that they will thoroughly enjoy.

In a sense of my experience with mattresses... I have been accumulated to a softer mattress. But this is more on the firm side. I have had REALLY soft mattresses before and have found them to be very tiresome. This creates a really food balance for the perfect amount of comfort a 7+ hour rest will need. You won't get the groggy feeling of struggling to get out of bed in the morning, but the feeling of springing out and enjoying to wake up.

6988,2015-06-13,Chris Wu,35.0,Queens, New York,5,Wonderful sleep. Worth every penny,"My wife and I have had our Casper for almost 2 months now and we love it so far! The first night I slept on it I felt an immediate difference. After about 3 nights, I felt my upper shoulder pain reduce and my back pain reduce overall.  Since then, I've continued to feel reduced overall back pain and have been getting more deep sleep with less interruptions through the night.

To give some background on myself, I've had chronic lower back pain and neck pain for the last 7 years or so. In the last year and a half, I've battled severe nerve pain down my lower left leg stemming from spinal stenosis. When I first got this condition, there was constant numbness and tingling pain in my lower extremities and I couldn't sit, stand, or lay down for more than 1 or 2 minutes before experiencing severe pain. After lots of physical therapy, chiropractic care, massage therapy, Accupuncture, change of diet, the whole nine yards, I am generally feeling much better.

With all that said, my main concern before buying a Casper was, ""Will this make my neck and back feel better?"" and my answer as of today, is ""yes, it does."" I can't make a medical recommendation because I'm not a doctor, so please don't think, ""Casper will cure my back pain I get from a bad mattress!"" It might, it might not. But from my personal experience, it has helped a lot with my upper neck and back pain. I still experience mid-back spasming and shoulder pain in the morning, but that's more from chronic issues. And that pain is much less than what I had before. I also noticed I am able to sleep longer without waking up from discomfort and back pain. 

My old mattress was my wife's, which we inherited when we first got married. I noticed it was starting to sag on my side and I would wake up in a lot of neck and shoulder pain in both arms. After switching to the Casper, I felt well supported, but very comfortable, and noticed my body could fall asleep faster, and stay asleep longer. I notice that my body feels straighter on a Casper, as opposed to dipping in the hip area. My neck and back feel support, but it doesn't feel stiff. It's still soft and very comfortable. It really is a mid-firmness mattress that suits most people's preferences for mattress type.

So, will a Casper cure your medical back issues? No. Will it help them in most cases? I believe so. Is the Casper super comfortable and worth every penny. Yes! 

Last thing I'll say that's a major difference between a Casper and a traditional mattress with springs inside is how the Casper ""hugs"" your body and absorbs vibration well so that if you tend to move a lot when you sleep, you don't feel the bounce back from springs as you toss and turn, and your body stays still much better. I think this a huge win with the Casper because it means your body doesn't experience as much movement when you're trying to fall asleep and you can concentrate on resting instead of trying to get into a comfortable sleeping position.

The 100-day policy made me feel very comfortable in our purchase.

The unboxing was very simple and it was ready to go within 10 mins once it was in the bedroom. Sorry no video but it was the same as the other 100s of unboxing videos. Oh I did not experience any smell at all like some people and I'm pretty sensitive to smells too. But we had a Select Comfort bed for over 10 years. It was getting to the point where I was changing sides a lot and waking up with my shoulders sore. And since I had multiple problems with the pump for the glorified air mattress I thought I would try something new & more reliable after hearing the praises from Leo Laporte. 

First thing I noticed after sleeping on the Casper is that I was remembering dreams again. I haven't done that in years! So that has to mean something. I love the feeling of the top cover. It is very soft. The Casper has a unique feel to it. Different than your typical memory foam mattress. I did not get hot on it like I did on a memory foam bed I tried one time. Temperature was very similar to a regular innerspring. I love that it doesn't transfer movement as much as an innerspring too. My wife doesn't wake me when she comes to bed or gets up so that's nice. 

I have to say that I'm very pleased with the Casper so far. I had one issue where my neck would be a little sore even after a month. I have a good pillow and never had the problem before. So I'm guessing that it is just a tad too firm since I sleep on my side. But it wasn't seriously bad. I told customer service about it and they were very accommodating in that they sent me a 1"" Casper latex foam mattress topper recently. This bumped up the softness tremendously and I can already tell a difference. So thank you for that kind of service! I know they are within the first successful year and probably looking for areas to improve. Kudos to that. I expect a lot of great things coming out of Casper. I suspect the additional layer of foam for side sleepers might come into play more in the future. 

For the price, quality, and customer service Casper can't be beat! The financing experience was very simple and easy as well. Both Casper & Affirm are like Apple of the mattress world.

I was totally surprised that the bed only needed a few minutes out of the box to be ready to sleep on, and there was no funny new mattress smell. I also didn't believe for one second that I wouldn't be sweltering all night like I was on our Tempurpedic, but I could not have been more wrong! Not only does the bed stay cool, I find that I actually sleep through the night without waking up - this was not even a remote possibility prior to this mattress! Now I don't want to get out of bed in the morning because I'm comfortable, not because I'm exhausted. What a difference! I think the bed is soft, my husband thinks the bed is firm ... either way, we are both sleeping great, and so are the dogs, cats, and pig that sleep with us!

I have now been using the Casper for just over 3 weeks and have found that I seem to be sleeping far more deeply than I used to.  It did take a few nights to get used to the mattress but now I find that I no longer am getting sleepy in the afternoon or evening and no longer absolutely must have an afternoon nap in order to get through the day.  So the mattress is definitely far, far better than the Select Comfort Sleep Number air mattress which I had been using for several years.  Due to having severe arthritis, tendonitis, and a multitude of old injuries it has always been difficult to find a bed that totally suits me since I need a firm bed for my bad back but then the firmness makes other parts of my body hurt.  I am using a 2-inch thick memory foam pad, which I already had, on top of the Casper mattress and this seems to work quite well for me.  However, I do still usually spend 2-3 hours of the night sleeping in my reclining chair due to having some pain although I probably could make it through the night staying in bed.  Once winter comes I will probably find it far easier to stay in bed all night since I always sleep better when it is very cold and dark plus  I do not heat the house during the night so it is far too cold to leave a warm bed to sleep in a reclining chair.  Therefore, all in all, I am quite happy with my Casper purchase and would recommend Casper to all other people who have a great number of bodily aches and pains like I do.  It would be well worth a try for anyone, especially considering the reasonable price compared to most other mattresses.  Thanks, Casper!",7,Sleeps solo,942,False,False,True,False,False

A coworker who had made most of his career as a manufacturers rep in the sleep industry lauded memory foam and latex hybrid sleep systems. 
I stumbled on the Casper mattress while reading reviews at sleeplikethedead. I read the reviews and watched the videos on the website. 
My wife and I really didnt want to spend a ton of money, and Consumer Reports had found that a higher price rarely resulted in a better product. My wife and I also did not want to make the trip to one of the many local retailers to identify our next mattress (with a quick 10 min ""try-out"", what do you really get?) 
The three reasons why we bought the mattress were the 100 night guarantee (there's not a better way to try it out), the technology incorporated into the product, and the price. That's right, price was not the main reason, as I would actually pay MORE for this mattress. 
The comfort of the mattress is on the firm side, but my wife and I both enjoy that. Although lush pillowtops are great at first, they lack the support that our backs require. The latex on top of this mattress really helps give it the cushion-like feel that we like, while the memory foam supports our bodies. 
The only difficulty we had was with the height. On our platform bed, it was a good 4-5 inches shorter, and we both felt as though we were too low.",6,Sleeps with a partner plus a dog,942,False,True,False,True,False

I'm also 160lbs at 5'7"" with a body fat of about 15%... My body is quite dense. 

This specific mattress is much more on the firmer side. I'd say the top layer is very nice and soft but the second layer is extremely tough. You know when you hit it and after getting there there isn't much give. 

I like to rotate in my sleep and I found sleeping on my side my hips would just not sink far enough to allow my back to be aligned.

I then tried sleeping on my stomach and my arms kept falling asleep. 

So all that was left is my back which makes it hrs to bury your face into your pillow in the morning or after a long hrs day.

I'm also not the only one who had this issue. I asked a few friends who were interested to try it out and they all said it was a bit on the hard side.

Also since I got it I've had trouble getting partners to sleep over because they do not enjoy sleeping on it. They tend to be more on the curvy side and have the same issues I have sleeping on their side while cuddling.

Clean & Thoughtful Design: 
I appreciated all the aesthetic details but that's really secondary. 

Sound sleep, and lots of it:
This mattress is so comfortable I'm always looking for excuses to go to bed or stay in bed longer. I usually come home from work and lay on my bed for about 10 minutes to mentally get myself out of work mode and into home mode. I never did this before I got a Casper mattress. I also got a furry cat around the same time I got this mattress-both have resulted in me spending way more time in bed but it's been splendid.

I plan to never, ever, ever step into a mattress shop --where they say ""guess what? there's a giant SALE"" every time I go in--ever again. Going mattress shopping is second in dreadful experiences only to car shopping and I'm glad I won't have to experience it ever again.

My wife and I tried out the mattress, and after a while found it to be less comfortable than our old one, and tried to initiate a return. Since then, there's been an overwhelming feeling of the process being dragged out on purpose to maybe see if we would keep the mattress anyway.

If you are converting from a regular box spring, you can NOT use it with your Casper mattress (despite what the instructions say that come in the box).  The slats and springs of a typical box spring are not adequate support for a foam mattress.

7117,2015-05-26,Mark Glazerman,37.0,New Baden, Illinois,2,Not what we hoped it would be...,"My wife and I were ready to replace our 8 year old inner-spring pillow top mattress so when I read about Casper and their claim that this mattress meets the Golidlocks standard of ""Just right"", we decided to give it a whirl.  Add to that the fact that we could try it for 100 nights and, if we didn't like it, they would pick it up and give us all of our money back... really, what did we have to lose ?  I was unable to get the free financing site to work, despite verifying my credit score etc.. but after a $50 online coupon plus an additional $50 taken off my Casper for my problems with the financing site, $750 sounded like a bargain for a memory foam mattress with a 10 year warranty and 100 night money back trial period.  We were sold.

The quality of the mattress is as described on the website.  I can't fault the speed of delivery, the quality of the craftmanship.  There was a slight odor after unpacking but it was gone within a night or two.  The mattress was ready to lay on in a matter of minutes and we excitedly slept on it the first night.  The mattress doesn't sleep hot (a worry of mine) and we have both commented that it isolates movement very well.

We loved the sales model, We loved the ease of purchase, We loved the warranty, we LOVED the unboxing and we desperately wanted to love the mattress.  Unfortunately, it didn't take us long to come to the realization that this wasn't the mattress for us.  We are both side sleepers and from the first morning, rather than seeing some of our aches and pains disappear in the cloud like softness of the casper, we began waking up with new aches and pains.  I am 220lbs and I wake up every day with achy ribs and sore shoulders.  My wife is 100lbs lighter than me and also wakes up with sore shoulders. This mattress is FIRM.  If this is in the middle of their soft -> fime scale then the firm end must be hardwood floors.  We have stayed in enough hotels to know that if this was typical of a hotel mattress, We would have never ordered it.  It's not uncomfortable to the point where we've started sleeping on the couch and It's not that we don't sleep at all when we were on it, it's just not a restful sleep and there is more tossing and turning on this new mattress than we ever had on our old one.  I read people describing the feeling as cloud like.  I cannot say that it has ever felt cloud like and, assuming it lives up to its 10 year warranty, I doubt that (to us) it ever will.

We stuck with it for just over a month before deciding we'd take Casper up on their offer to collect it and process a refund.  That's where we've run into some more difficulties.  We live about 25 minutes from St. Louis.  It's not a sprawling metropolis but it's not the Appalachians either.  Casper has spent more than 2 weeks trying to find someone to come and collect the mattress, all the while my refund is waiting for confirmation that the mattress has been picked up (which it hasn't yet by the way).  Apparently their usual charity / recycling partner doesn't operate in our area.  Currently, the recycler they have found is still waiting for the check that is being sent to them to cover the cost of picking up our mattress.  

We just ordered a new mattress (a hybrid mattress by Sealy if anyone is interested) from the kind of store I was hoping to avoid with the Casper.  As it turned out, it was a super easy and stress free shopping experience handled by a salesman who educated us on the fact that firmness and support do not mean the same thing and that you can have a reasonably soft mattress that still provides the support that side sleepers need.  Yes, it cost more and no, it won't arrive in a cool vacuum packed box but hopefully we'll get a good nights sleep on it.

Bottom line, if you like seriously firm mattresses then this is a great price for what I suspect will be a very long lasting mattress.  However, if you like a little give and spend most of your time on your side, I wouldn't tell you not to try a Casper mattress but I'd be prepared to have to send it back.

7132,2015-05-22,Emily Hammel,29.0,Quakertown, Pennsylvania,4,"Researched Extensively, Great for the Price","I had an 11-year-old spring mattress and was tired of ""falling"" into the divot made by my boyfriend's weight.  I did a TON of research to find the best mattresses that were:

1) soft enough for side-sleepers
2) supportive enough for stomach-sleepers
3) motion isolation for light-sleepers
4) not too hot.

Foam/latex options seemed to meet all the criteria.  I considered Tempur-Pedic because of their long-term happy customers. I have slept on a few Tempur-Pedics and honestly would have bought one if they weren't so expensive.  Casper's short time in business made me nervous, but the user reviews, cost, free shipping and 100-day trial persuaded me.  I also thought it was cool that they donate the mattress if you don't like it, rather than put in in a landfill like Tempur-Pedic...while charging you $150 to do it!

Setup was easy.  The smell was chemically and a bit sweet.  It lasted about 2 weeks but wasn't too strong.  Here's how it added up to my 4 criteria:

1) My first impression was that I wanted it to be a little softer.  That feeling continued and I eventually requested the latex mattress topper from Casper.  They made me wait a month before sending it, but it's been on my bed for 2 months and I prefer it. It cradles my body a bit more, and makes side-sleeping more comfortable.  The latex topper DOES reduce impact when doing other ""activities"" which is a chief complaint about foam mattresses.  Oh well... Get creative ;)

2) The mattress WITHOUT the topper was fine for supportive stomach-sleeping.  I prefer it with the topper, as I change positions a lot in the night and want all of them to be comfortable.

3) The motion isolation is pretty good.  I can feel it when my boyfriend rolls over, but it's not jarring.  There is no ""divot"" from his weight unless he's lying right next to me, and it's still pretty minimal even then.

4) It definitely sleeps hotter than I wanted.  I'm a naturally cold person and usually use a flat sheet, thin woven cotton blanket, and feather blanket. With the Casper, I woke up covered in sweat multiple times, which is rare for me.  And gross.  I recommend 100% cotton sheets and blankets. It was way too sweaty with a 50/50 cotton/poly ""T-Shirt"" sheet.  I replaced the feather blanket with a cotton quilt since I like to sleep with a blanket ""weight"" on top of me. I also sleep with a fan for noise muffling, so I now I also aim it at the bed and it's fine.

Overall, this was a good investment, but not the total love affair I was hoping for.  I researched mattress types and brands for HOURS and it was between a Tempur-Pedic and this.  Tempur-Pedics sleep notoriously hot AND they're way outta my budget.  Casper it is!

7142,2015-05-19,Jodi Janczewski,39.0,Madison, Wisconsin,5,Skeptical but surprised,"I have to admit that I was hopeful but skeptical about the numerous positive reviews for the Casper mattress.  But, at half the price of the mattress that I picked out at a furniture store (the Sealy Optimum Radiance Gold) and with the 100-night money-back guarantee, I had to take a chance and give it a try.  It was just under a week from the time I placed the order until delivery, which was fantastic.  I was excited to test it out.  Upon first lying down, I thought it was comfortable.  It felt soft.  The mattress lets you sink into it a little without feeling swallowed by it.  It wasnt hot.  I did read that you have to give your body a couple of weeks to get used to the mattress, especially if you are used to sleeping on inner spring mattresses and this was true.  In some ways it was less pressure than my inner spring mattress  less heel pressure when lying on my back and less hip and shoulder pain from side sleeping  but I was a bit achy and sore all over in the mornings (lasted about 10 days).  Before buying this mattress, I had done a lot of shopping and had read a lot of reviews.  I wasnt greatly impressed by any of the Ikea latex and foam mattresses.  I did not like the cost, heat or level of sinking of Tempur-pedic mattresses.  I was done with buying inner spring mattresses.  I learned terms like motion isolation and off-gassing  if you have looked at sleeplikethedead.com, you know what I am talking about.  So, Ill tell you what I think now that I have had it for a couple of months.  It had very little to no off gassing (smell when you open it).  The motion isolation is awesome.  You cant jump on the bed with a glass of wine on it without cleaning up a mess but if you sleep with a partner that turns over violently in the night, like I do (sorry babe), then you will appreciate this feature.  I am a rotisserie sleeper (back, left side, stomach, right side, back).  My partner is a stomach sleeper mostly.  This mattress is way more comfortable than my old mattress.  We both felt it was a little on the firm side and we were looking for something luxuriously soft.  I am the kind of shopper that buys something and then wonders if I bought the right thing or if there is something better out there that I should have bought instead.  So, we went back to the furniture store to lie on the mattress we thought was so great but too expensive.  It was no longer comfortable  too sinky and not supportive enough.  I emailed Casper to ask about a mattress topper to make it softer.  I had read that they would send you one for free in a review somewhere.  I thought the review said they would ship one from Amazon.  I was pleasantly surprised that they sent me a soft latex mattress topper made by Casper to work with their mattress and to fit perfectly on top of it (same exact dimensions).  It also had straps to secure the topper onto the mattress to keep it from shifting.  And it really was free.  Wow!  What a difference!  The mattress that we liked but still had some lingering thoughts that maybe we could do better was definitively the one!  We are keeping it and are happy to lie down in bed at night.  I have travelled a few times since we got our bed and I am tolerant but not happy to sleep on other mattresses.  My partner is a stomach sleeper and the topper made all of the difference with comfort for him.  I rotisserie, like I said, and it is now good for all sleeping positions.  It is a few degrees warmer with the topper, but then again, it changed from winter to spring here so maybe it is not the mattress at all.  It is not a heat retainer by any means.  Maybe one day Casper will make a firm and a soft mattress for peoples preferences but until then, the topper is a good solution for a softer bed.  I expect the mattress to last a long time without the springs, since that is what causes them to sag in the middle or squeak when you get in and out.  My 13 year old dog, who never wanted to sleep on the bed, is getting up into the bed at night now and snuggling for an hour before getting down to his dog bed on the floor.  And sometimes when I come home from work I see the bedspread is wrinkled because he got up there for a daytime nap.  Its a great price, has fast shipping, is human and old-dog approved, has a no-hassle money back return policy and has an option to make it softer if needed so what are you waiting for?  Take the chance.  I feel like a Casper-salesperson talking to my friends about it but it was a great deal and worth every penny.",8,Dort avec un(e) partenaire et un chien,955,False,True,False,True,True

I had no reservations about buying a Casper from reading other expectations as a Goldilocks mattress. Just the opposite. For a mattress you going to sleep on daily, it's really uncomfortable, and more of a hot piece of foam, 90%, that is woefully overpriced and not a good value. 

Delivery was problematic (cost me 2 days of work to stay at home and sign for this), and I ended up having pick it up myself and hauling a heavy box through the snow. Unboxing was easy, and neat, no off gassing smell. First night was ok, but then, my limbs started falling asleep and I started waking up in the middle of the night like a hot mess. And that's without sex!

Turns out they were mistaken and it arrived two days after it shipped but it did take 2-3 days to actually ship. I think this could have been a bit clearer.

The only real complaint I have is with regard to the edges of the mattress. They don't offer much support so if you're at the edge you might feel like you're falling off...or if you sit on it to put on your socks for example. I guess this is what comes with a mattress of this type?

Nothing worked.  I finally decided to replace my 15 year old mattress and was discouraged by the high cost of name brand memory foam mattresses.  Someone steered me towards Casper.com and I was immediately intrigued.  It was a little scary to buy a mattress without ever seeing it or laying on it.  Maybe it was the latest bout of insomnia but after nearly a week of only sleeping an hour or two at a time I took the chance.  Well night one I had the best night sleep I have had in 20 years.

I bought it kind of spur of the moment after seeing it mentioned on Jezebel. I've had kind of a miserable two years with my twice-the-price memory foam mattress. To start with, I'm maybe the most difficult person alive when it comes to mattresses. I'm an insomniac (a bad one... I often go multiple days with no sleep at all), and it takes very little for me to be too uncomfortable to sleep. I hate memory foam but unfortunately let myself be talked into it during my last mattress purchase. The way Casper was described as being a balance between memory foam and springs was really appealing to me and I figured I had nothing to lose.

First, the mattress shipped immediately, despite a warning of there being a reasonable delay due to high order volume. On top of that, it arrived a day early. I didn't know that was even possible.  

The packaging and print materials were lovely. Simple and very modern. I actually brought it into work to show people the next day. And there was a hand written thank you note included, which I thought was cool.

Gauntt,58.0,Fayettville, Georgia,5,Lifetime Best Bargain - Great Sleep,"I am a real Casper customer and even though this review may be lengthy I hope it will help others who are on the fence about purchasing a Casper mattress.  My wife and I are in our late 50s and wanted to make our next, and hopefully last, mattress purchase carefully.  We had been very pleased with our 2004 model year Tempurpedic which we will still use in a spare bedroom.  It provided no frills just great support and a thin profile.  Our only goals were to improve the sleep surface, if possible, and maybe achieve a cooler sleep surface for the hot southern summer months.  We also wanted an adjustable base.

We found a very expensive online mattress option that included a fantastic adjustable base.   After sleeping on the mattress, however, we found it was too thick and did not support our backs well enough; note: we are not overweight.  Thus, we started looking around at every store and option. 

We knew we were memory foam advocates, but found that all the new Tempurpedics and other memory foam manufacturers made products that felt like you were sinking into when you laid down.  We never found one model in a store to test out where we did not have a difficult time extracting ourselves as we would attempt to get out of the bed.  We also looked at the least expensive options (still relatively expensive) from Sleep Number but became increasingly frustrated with not only the higher costs of the products and the accessories.  We just could not seem to find an improved sleep surface that also provided a little more coolness and met all of  the things on our wish list for comfort and cost effectiveness.

Enter Consumer Reports and a brief look at two very inexpensive options led us to Casper.

If you know you prefer an extremely firm bed then for the price point and coolness factor, Casper might be right for you.

I loved the reviews on this site, and the Youtube video reviews were also helpful. My husband was skeptical about buying a mattress on the Internet, but the 100-night trial put his mind at ease.

When the king-sized Casper arrived, we retired our ancient spring mattress and traditional box spring. The unboxing was a sight to see. We were mesmerized as the Casper unfurled itself, sort of like a butterfly emerging from a coccoon. We covered it with sheets and got down to the business of sleeping.

At first, we had no box spring, due to a timing issue (i.e., I forgot to order it in time for it to arrive with the mattress.) So, we ended up putting the mattress directly on the floor, as pictured several places on the website. This did not end up being a problem at all. The mattress is firm enough that we both felt supported, and after that first night, we both commented on how soundly we slept for the first time in a few years. It really was a huge difference not feeling the springs of our old mattress pressing on our bodies. When our new box spring arrived, we repositioned the mattress on it, and it has been pleasant dreams ever since!

With the good comes the bad, so the single biggest thing we have to complain about is the factory odor of the mattress lingering for weeks. We've had the bed for nearly two months, and the subtle, slightly chemical smell is just now starting to dissipate. If you're sensitive to such things, take notice.

This intrigued me as I had never heard of this mattress, and so I started to do some research and see what it was all about.

After reading the reviews on this site, and on the other board, I noticed that they had a showroom in NYC, so I made an appt to check it out first hand -- since I was not comfortable plucking down $800 for a mattress that I  had yet to try, even with their ridiculous 100 Night guarantee -- and when I got there, I was met with a very courteous and friendly staff who led me to a private bedroom with my own casper mattress to try.  They gave me about 30min to sleep on it, nap on it, toss and turn on it, whatever I wanted really.  This really helped make my decision, since most mattress shops look at you funny if you lay on a mattress more than a few minutes, and with this mattress being a memory foam/Latex hybrid I was nervous that when I laid down, I was going to sink right in... thankfully that did not happen.  After my 30min were up, and I headed back out into the living room, I knew I was going to be ordering one of these mattresses just as soon as I got home.

I got home, ordered the mattress immediately and it showed up in a few days in this crazy box, which I them immediately opened, and unfurled it on my boxspring.  I let it sit for a few moments so that it could reshape itself and air itself out (how do you think you would smell trapped in a box for a few days!).  Once it was ready to go, I threw on sheets and took a nap.  I fell asleep almost instantly, some I never do, and I had one of the most restful sleeps ever... but yeah, it was nap, so what... How was your first",7,Sleeps solo,968,False,False,True,False,False

7270,2015-04-27,John Charpentier,36.0,New Iberia, Louisiana,5,Great Product,"A few years ago we were sleeping on a pillow top inner spring mattress.  I began to wake up each morning with moderate to sever back pain.  To my wife the mattress was the best mattress she ever slept in.  After much discussion we agreed to look for a new mattress.  I did my researched and we looked at different options and agreed to purchase a Sleep Number bed.  My back pain stopped, but my wife went from the best mattress she ever slept in to waking up with pack pain.  Fast forward 2 years and after trying every setting  possible my wife was still waking up hurting.  After going on vacation last month and sleeping in a memory foam bed for the week we both had a positive sleeping experience and were pain free each morning.   So we decided to look for a new mattress that would work for both of us.  I did some research and went to different stores talked to salesmen and after about 3 weeks of reading and looking we were leaning towards a memory foam bed by a large manufacture.  I was hesitant due to price, inherit issues with memory foam and some reviews I had read.  I picked up a Consumer Reports and low and behold mattress were part of the monthly issue.  After reading the report and watching the video's online the Casper peaked my interest due to the high score it received for side sleepers as I am a side sleeper.  I started to research Casper and was impressed with what I read from multiple sources.  Being a designer and a project manager who works for an engineering firm I always love per say when someone finds a way to build a better mouse trap.  After reading and discussing it with my wife I ordered the mattress through the website during my lunch hour which only took a few minutes.  No salesman to haggle with and no time lost out of my busy day.  I received email notifications throughout the process and the mattress arrived as scheduled.  It was easy to unbox and unwrap.  I like the simplicity and attention to detail with the private note and paperwork received with the mattress.  The mattress looks and feels like a quality product and is very comfortable.  Its only been a few nights but my wife nor I have had any pain upon waking up.  I contacted customer service using the chat option on the website and Katie was very nice and help",6,Sleeps with a partner,968,False,True,False,False,False

As a stomach sleeper I need a firm bed, but as a person who sits on my bed a lot, sometimes with multiple other people at the same time, I like it to be cushy as well. The Casper delivers - I get all the support I need (especially in my lower back, where it is needed the most) but as I sit on the bed right now, it is very comfortable and even has a little bounce.

It's hard to get a grad student to spend much money on anything, but after 4 years of age-old dorm beds, cheap futons, and second-hand spring mattresses, I was in desperate need of an upgrade.

The Casper mattress is the perfect balance between soft and firm, offering just the right amount of comfort and support.  I realize that it is hard to glean from a written review just what that feels like, but as an analog, I'd peg it at a little bit softer than ""grassy meadow,"" if that makes any sense to you.  You can feel a definite firmness at the base, with just enough give in the foam to make you comfortable without feeling like you're sinking.

It might seem daunting to purchase a mattress without ever trying it (and I'm sure my attempted description didn't offer much clarity on that front), but I can honestly say that it was worth it.

We had struggled for several years to find a mattress that worked for both of us. 

We became disillusioned with spring mattresses that seemed to always find a way to dig into our bodies, waking us with a need to reposition.  We had tried a variety of foam, pillow top and were considering an air bed.  One of our problems was that we travel a bit for work, usually a part of every week and the adjustment to a variety of beds was difficult.  Coming home and laying on a bed that was completely different than those in hotels would cost my husband a couple nights sleep while he adjusted to the softness of foam.  

Also, while we wanted a 'soft' bed, we did not want one that we sunk into and had to 'climb' out of to turn over.  We also did not want to feel heated by the bed.  Certainly we wanted our bed at home to be very comfortable, but not have the initial feel to be so very different that it was an adjustment to sleep on it.

We tried the Casper bed because of the story, the American made products, and the idea that it might work OK.  Also the price.  We had spent up to three times more in search a great mattress.The guarantee cinched it because we had nothing to lose.

I loved it from the beginning!  My husband took a while to get used to it.  In fact since we travel he had not been able to sleep on it more than 30% of the time when when the trial time had run out.   He was not completely sure about it, but we let the date get away from us and we were stuck.  The very next week he was home for most of the week and after a few more nights in a row sleeping on the Casper, he was happy as well.  Another month and he had no problem adjusting back and forth!  

Now, over a year later we are both thrilled!  We recommend Casper to anyone buying a mattress!!!

I was attracted to the price point given the construction and design normally being much more expensive, but what really got my attention was their risk-free trial. I decided to go for it and I haven't looked back since. Now that I've slept on it for a while, I can confidently say to this day, this mattress is one of the best purchases I have ever made. Now, I can sleep without my CPAP and still wake up feeling rested.

We unwrapped it and placed it on our bed and then let it do its thing. After a few minutes, it was fully inflated. Our first nights sleep was not the best, but we decided to be optimistic and let our bodies get adjusted, especially since our old mattresses were so old.

7405,2015-03-04,Terry Gascon,34.0,Calgary,Calgary,4,Its only  been 2 days but I'm liking it so far.,"So for the last few years I've been getting less and less sleep. Tossing and turning all night long. Flipping from one shoulder when it got to sore to the other, on the hour like clock work all night long... That combined with a over active bladder that seems to act up more when I'm super tired, had me getting up 4 of 5 times a night. Sleep is more a fantasy then a reality. So i saw the Casper on Facebook, read the reviews and decided to take a chance.

Shipping: Was not super impressed with the fact the order wasn't shipped out for 48 hours(Business days only). I made the purchase early Friday morning, so it was not shipped till Tuesday afternoon. Then it was originally scheduled to be delivered on Thursday, then it was Friday.. then Friday it was delayed in Nashville due to severe weather conditions. So it got delivered on Monday. Two day shipping turned into ten days. 
When it did show up Monday UPS just left it sitting next to my door. Even tho I checked the signature required box. I don't live in the best part of town and they left my $1000 mattress just sitting on my door step!!! My roommate was home waiting for them. Didn't knock on the door, thank god i was checking the status on my phone ever 10 mins. That's not really on Casper, but they should seriously looking using another carrier in Canada. I've had problems with UPS in the past, sticker on the door and driving away with out even knocking.

The Mattress: Unboxing was fun and pretty easy. Handles sewn into the side of the mattress would be nice as it is pretty heavy. The mattress itself was a lot firmer then I was expecting. On a scale of 1-10 I'd say its a 7 or 8 not a 5. Tho I only weight 170lbs so maybe like that other review i read I'm just to skinny to really sink into it. 
The first night I turned over a few times but not nearly as much as normal. Woke up a bit stiff.
Second night: Slept for 10 hours, think I turned over twice. Woke up for the first time in months not feeling like crap!

So heres hoping that it only gets better from here. So far I'm really liking the Casper. I'll writing another review in a month or so and let everyone know how its going.",5,Sleeps solo plus a cat,982,False,False,True,True,False

When the box arrived, my wife and I were pretty excited - and skeptical. How could they possibly maintain the integrity of this mattress cramped inside a relatively small box? Well, like magic (and, of course, following the directions), we had a gorgeous new Casper ready to go in seconds from the unboxing. It was so cool.

Now came the moment of truth - testing the bed out. At first, I thought it was a bit more firm than I expected. It's generally rated at a 5 on a scale of 10, but I would say a solid 6, close to 7 would be more accurate. My wife agreed. The first night on the mattress was the real test. Still, it felt just a tad too firm, so I called Casper to express my concerns. The great guy I spoke to on the phone asked questions about the setup and our sleeping habits to help come up with a solution. He suggested adding a foam topper, provided by them free of charge, would do the trick. We haven't gotten it yet, but I have a feeling it will make all the difference.

In the meantime, we are still enjoying better rest than we had with our previous mattress.

It's just to firm for us.  We currently use a Sterns and Foster firm with a 3"" foam pad.   We are both very active but age is catching up to us.  As slide sleepers, we're looking for something softer on our shoulders.  Her weight is 105, likely just too light for this setup, mine is 195 @6'1"".  We both found it hard.  This of course is a very personal thing that is difficult to describe unless you too give it a try.

7410,2015-03-02,Nate,44.0,Brooklyn, New York,5,"Quality Mattress, Great Service","Overall I was very impressed with the Casper service and quality - the experience of ordering and taking delivery was extremely efficient, and the level of communication was very good. This is particularly important when dealing with a bed delivery, since buying a new bed usually involves getting rid of an old one, and the timing is critical so that you don't end up with an extra bed taking up space, or worse not having any bed at all. Casper kept me updated as the bed was shipping and arranged for delivery with plenty of notice. In NYC where I live, that actually included a phone call in advance with an accurate specific delivery time down to the minute (not a ""window"" of four hours like the cable company might give you).

The mattress itself is well designed (not that you really see it that often, but it is nice) and has a very high quality feel. The top portion of the mattress, which is a couple inches of latex, is super soft and is pleasant to roll in to. The layer below offers more support, but is still relatively soft. I've read reviews that on a scale of 1 to 10 for firmness, the Casper rates about a 5 and I think that's pretty accurate. 

The nicest thing about a foam mattress is definitely the lack of lumps - coming from an aging spring mattress I didn't know if I would take to foam, but I find it more comfortable and the support is more even. Ultimately the Casper was a little too soft for me, but even the experience of returning it was efficient and pleasant. I'd buy a Casper mattress again if there were a firmer model, and I'd certainly recommend it to friends who prefer a medium firmness bed.",7,Sleeps with a partner plus a dog,982,False,True,False,True,False

Clarke,49.0,Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,5,I'm in LOVE with Casper!,"I'm a skeptic when it comes to my sleep, especially mattresses, and even more skeptical on memory foam ones, having slept on my share of clunkers (sofabed springs or mattress buttons biting back at night, anyone?): futons, too-soft mattresses, air-beds (not a god idea with pets around!), hot foam mattresses (temperature, not certain activities) and most recently, a specific air-mattress company that, after five years, didn't do much for my sleep (which they'd promised a 20 yr. guarantee, but, alas ...).

But then ... Casper came into my life (which I'm biased: I love the name, and heard the product advertised on a syndicated talk show). So, based on that, the reviews here, the engineering (I'm a space geek, too), and the return policy, why not give it a spin?

One word--from when this cute box first came off the UPS truck to when I got it in my cozy attic bedroom, to the unveiling process (don't let this bed fool ya, it's rather heavy to move): WOW!!!!!! Now mind you, I work in retail, and when I first tested the bed, my lower right leg, which had been giving me pain-related weather- and stress-issues in recent weeks, lessened in minutes (no exaggeration). Three nights into this purchase, the leg pain's gone. Poof. Ghost. (I had to say it, haha...!)

And hubby isn't snoring much anymore!

Can you see I'm wild about Casper? Fantastic product, folks. And when this mattress needs to be replaced, I sure hope you're around years from now to make this purchase again.

P.S.: Went bedding shopping recently, and the girl in the store said she'd been hearing about this product; if this was a great bed before with my previous pillows, this is a lock of a winner with my new bedding now.

My wife and I are both slender, and we don't have the muscle mass we did 20 or 30 yrs ago.  Consequently we are both vulnerable to pressure points when we sleep.  Issues that probably most younger and/or buyers don't have.  While we feel the Casper is well-made and very good value (not to speak of the great painless buying/trying experience), it is too firm for both of us, and my wife prefers firm.  I have to take issue with the claim that the Casper emulates the feel of mattresses used in high-end hotels; for years my work travel had me staying in fine hotels all over the U.S. and overseas, and IME the Casper is definitely more firm.  All that said, we purchased a memory foam topper that makes the Casper perfect for my wife.  I needed a softer topper (so 2 twins on a king), and now the pressure point discomfort is gone.  Long story short, we really like the Casper and expect that our needing to supplement it with toppers is no doubt the exception that most buyers will not need to do.

I'm usually recovering from some kind of minor fight injury.  Because I'm 43, I often get a mild lower back strain from fighting.  My old mattress was lumpy and I was experiencing chronic pain even after several good night's rest.  I was in the market for a new mattress but dreaded shopping for another one, as my previous mattress had been bought at a brand name showroom only 3 years prior, and was very expensive.  

When I read the Capser reviews, I was intrigued, particularly by other athletes and jiu jitsu practitioners who had similar problems as my own.   And the price I couldn't beat.  I had slept well on a hybrid mattress similar to this one a decade ago, made by DWR, and I figured I would take a chance on this one.   The price was lower than other mattresses, and if I didn't like it, I could just return it.

The mattress turned out to be a life saver.  After one night's sleep, NO MORE BACK PAIN.  I could barely believe it, so I held off writing a review for months so I could be sure.  And, when I do fight and get injured, or my back hurts, I know that after a good night's sleep I'll be healed.  I've also noticed I don't wake up anymore at night turning over or in pain, so of course I feel far more refreshed than I did on my old mattress.  A good night's sleep like this, consistently, is priceless, which is why this mattress gets 5 stars easily.

I like to describe this mattress to friends as like sleeping in a hammock.  I feel fully supported, and sleep like I'm floating.  However when I first lie down, it feels like a mix of firm but springy, kind of like a hammock.  The mattress is very comfortable.  My dog loves it too.

7506,2015-01-14,Robert Schuerhoff,67.0,Denver, Colorado,5,Paradise Found,"After 30 years of back & hip pain, along with a serious sleep disorder, I decided  to abandon coil springs and try this mattress. Delivery to Colorado was 3 days, unpacking was a breeze, and I never detected any off-gassing odor. Following 2 nights of expected adjustment to memory foam, my sleeping after 5 weeks has become truly revolutionary. On coil spring mattresses I could only sleep on my side, but now can assume any position imaginable, usually my old childhood favorite of stomach or ""starfish,"" even on my back which is a first. I believe that this comes from Casper's uniform support design which eliminates pressure points and undue sagging. Back & hip pain have even diminished, more than I'd hoped for.

The Casper is not a ""swallow me up"" or squishy type. I've always preferred a pretty firm mattress, and this delivers firm support without any ""hardness"" pain often felt on coil springs. My most welcome result is sleeping soundly through the night without interruption, and going back to sleep if desired is so easy.  When I awake for the first time now, I usually look at the clock and say ""I can't believe that!"" Previously getting about 6 hours of sleep a night, I'm now averaging 8, which really is revolutionary. No joke - it's difficult getting out of bed because you know that is the most comfortable place you'll be for the rest of the day.

7535,2014-12-30,Chuck Renaud,43.0,Bartlett, Illinois,1,Low quality and not durable.,"The mattress gets zero stars, though the customer service was generally good.

The foam in our mattress started getting soft spots after three weeks.  By two months, we were no longer able to suffer through it and we ""returned"" the mattress.

Key points about our Casper experience:

1. Soft spots developed quickly.  I previously owned a $300 memory foam mattress (from woot.com) that lasted two years before breaking down.

2. While customer service was generally good, I had a couple of frustrating exchanges with them, including a suggestion that I put the mattress on the floor and use it that way (despite having it on a 3/4"" OSB platform) and the promise of a callback that didn't happen (forcing me to chase them down).  All that said, the overall experience was still on the positive.

3. There was an initial expectation set that, if the mattress didn't work out, it would be donated to charity.  Because of this, we took extra care to ensure that a fully enclosed waterproof pad was kept on the mattress.  When we initiated the return, however, we were told that they would not allow the donation of a mattress per their lawyers.  I'll add here that both Salvation Army and Savers were willing to take the mattress and provide proof of pickup.  Also, Casper's competition does this without any legal issues.  So this was a bit of a disappointment to me as it means more landfill material.

4. There's absolutely no edge support (unlike much of the competitive offerings).  I think this helped accelerate the breakdown of our mattress.

In the end, we just found the mattress foam to be low-quality.  We ended up buying a Sleep Science mattress from Costco for a bit more money and are already happier with it.

If I had to pick a target audience for Casper mattresses, I'd suggest one of the following:

1. Single person who sleeps in the center of the mattress.

2. A couple with a king-size mattress (again, keeping away from the edges).

3. People of below-average weight.  I'm 5'11"" and 230 lbs and it only took 3 weeks to notice soft spots.  However, my wife weighs below the average and she found soft spots after a month and a half.

There is no such thing as ""one size fits all"" for mattresses.  While Casper gets kudos for greatly simpliflying a frustrating process, they need a couple more options and they should consider using higher-quality materials.",6,Sleeps with a partner plus a cat,995,False,True,False,True,False

Since I live in NYC, I ordered in the morning and had my mattress that afternoon. Purchase, delivery and setup were easy and (dare I say) fun - no dealing with salesmen, no excessive choices between seemingly identical mattresses, and no waiting around during delivery times. All I wanted was a mattress that someone had created with my sleep (and not my wallet) in mind and I got it with Casper! I can confidently say that the Casper mattress is a bargain when compared to similar mattresses.
 
When I first hopped on the bed, I was very surprised by how firm the mattress actually was. I previously slept on a cheap traditional mattress (bare bones, no pillow top) with a 2 inch memory foam cushion. I loved my memory foam topper but it did have a lot of give and I would sink into the middle of the bed by the morning.

The Casper mattress gives you that form fitting ""hug"" that I loved from my memory foam topper without the sink. When you first lay on it, the mattress feels firm but then quickly forms to your body. It really hits the perfect spot between firm and soft - it's perfect! Another plus is that the mattress runs cool to the touch and doesn't get warm (which is awesome because I cannot be hot when I sleep). 

In the time I've slept on the mattress I haven't woken up with any aches or pains. I usually rotate between my stomach, back, and side depending on how I feel and so far all three have been perfectly comfortable.

7562,2014-12-10,Ed & Caryl,65.0,Raleigh, North Carolina,5,"Perfect, when customized","As we got older and older, our ridiculous $2,500 18"" mattress got harder and harder.  Up until I was in my late 30s, I could sleep on anything (or anyone). For the past few years, we avoided going to a mattress store like the plague -- we dreaded the nonsensical sale pitches that insulted our intelligence.  And my shoulder pain got worse and worse.  I made an appointment to a pain clinic.

As I was talking to my wife about mattresses, she saw an article in the NYT about Casper so I looked into this.  One mattress, one price, satisfaction 100% guaranteed, free shipping.  I read each and every review.  Some people said that the mattress was too hard, some said too soft.  I watched the youtube videos.  I finally called Casper (on a Sunday night) and expressed my reservations.  He said (heavily paraphrased), ""go ahead and try it, you can't lose).  So I bought it.

Just a few days later (even with an expected delay due to the NYT article) and far from NYC, the UPS guy knocks on the door with a really big box.  He graciously drops it off into the foyer.

My challenge is to get it up the stairs single handedly since my wife can't help and there's no one around to assist right off.

I'm really, really small.  I can easily fit in the box with plenty of room to spare.  And I'm old.  I remember watching horse drawn carts in NYC (seriously!).  My wife also remembers the horse-drawn carts for the rag man (calling out rags!, rags!) and the guy who sharpened blades.  We witnessed the end of an era.  But, I digress. 

I get the box upstairs without too much trouble.  Unlike the videos, I get the mattress out  of the box and inflated very quickly.  Oops, it's upside down.  A few seconds later it's flipped.  Easy.

We try the bed out for a quick test.  Seems comfy.  Wife is happy and goes off.  I stay on the bed for 30 minutes and I'm satisfied.  Even though I'm hyper sensitive to odors, I can't detect any outgassing at all.  I'm thrilled.

But the next morning we both wake up in joint pain -- 30 minutes wasn't enough time to truly test the bed.  However, we don't call or complain.  When we buy, for example, good clothing that doesn't fit perfectly, we get it tailored.  If a blanket isn't warm enough, we layer. So we decided to customize our bed to make it absolutely perfect for us.

We bought some toppers and used an old thick foam topper from the guest bed.  With the soft toppers and firm bed, we're still getting good back support and we're sleeping better.

Days later I cancel the appointment with the pain clinic -- the shoulder pain has disappeared.

One thing you should be aware of:  Depending upon where you live, you might find it difficult, very difficult, to donate a mattress -- even a mattress that is 100% like-new spotlessly clean (our old mattress was always covered in plastic).  These restrictions are relatively new.  Finally, after many phone calls, an animal rescue place would take our mattress provided we had more than one item to donate.

My enthusiasm about this mattress has not changed. I don't think I've ever slept this well.  Our first night, my husband and I got into bed and we both just started laughing. The difference between our new Casper mattress and our old spring mattress literally brought us to laughter. I was asleep in under 10 min. For someone who has previously had insomnia issues, occasionally requiring prescription medications, falling asleep under 10 minutes is unheard of. That night, I slept 6 straight hours and woke up, bright eyed and bushy-tailed, at 5:15 am without an alarm clock (it was set for 6am... ).  I am not and never have been a morning person. Even as a child, my parents had a rule of not talking to me until there were double digits on the clock. 5:15 with no alarm clock and I was talking...  Unbelievable!!  Since then, I've continued sleeping through the night and falling asleep like a normal person without pharmaceutical assistance (I'm not saying this will work for everyone, just saying it's helped me).  I was concerned about the mattress being made of latex foam. I'm a RN, and found out in nursing school that I am allergic to latex. While using latex gloves, my hands would turn bright red and swell.  So, the idea of sleeping on something that might bring on the same reaction but over my whole body did make me nervous.  I'm very happy to say that I have had no reaction to the latex in the mattress. That being said, the Casper mattress has a cover, we put a fitted sheet on it, and I wear at least shorts and t-shirt to bed.  Again, I'm not saying no one will react to the latex, just saying I haven't.  My husband and I couldn't be happier with our Casper mattress and have recommended to friends and family already.

Representations were made and I was intrigued. My back was aching from my lousy old mattress as I read reviews, compared other mattresses and considered my options.  I went for it. The $50 off code helped, sure, but the promise of feeling good in the morning was just too enticing.  We ordered and waited. 

A week later my wife sent me a text: ""It's here"", but instead of a mattress, I found a big box in my garage. I was surprised and concerned. What did I get myself into? The clever and useful instructions made the un-boxing process easy and weirdly entertaining. Still I wasn't sure what I had done and worried about what kind of hassle I'd get into sending this thing back. 

Then I  shut up long enough to lie down. Good grief. It was wonderful. I became a little giddy with surprise at how good it felt, and the feeling has only improved over the two weeks we've had this mattress.

Unboxing was easy with the included cutting instrument, and in less than 3 minutes there was a brand new mattress on my bed.

It is definitely squishier on the top than I expected based on the support description. I decided to suspend disbelief and just go with it. I was giddily excited to go to bed that first night, which is truly *not* like me. I'm a terrible sleeper. I get 6 hours of sleep a night if I'm lucky. I go from back to one side to the other, because of back and neck pain waking me up. I've tried memory foam and conventional mattresses without any real difference.

The first night I essentially slept straight through the night in one position--unheard of for me. I was waiting for soreness or some fallout from such a significant mattress change, but nothing. Still cozy and comfortable two weeks in. I think my back is actually helped by the mattress...I have hopes I can say that about my neck in a bit more time, but it is stubbornly resistant to improvement.

First off, I wish I could have given 5 stars, but it lacks that wow factor after several weeks.  The first few weeks were amazing, perhaps a placebo effect.  Then, my sleepless nights came back.  Definitely not Casper's fault, probably my annoying neighbors listening to Nickelback.  

The mattress has begun to break in a bit, or perhaps my body has adjusted, not sure.  The best thing is that is it conforming yet supportive.  I do a lot of kickboxing and often have massive thigh bruises that can make it difficult to side-sleep.  Casper does a gentle job of carrying me away to sleep without pain.  

The edge support is what really gave the mattress 4 stars.  If you share a bed and go anywhere near the edge, it will give you no warning before giving you a quick dump off the side.  Luckily, there is carpet to break the fall.

I got incrementally better with yoga and physical therapy, but I often woke up in pain early in the morning - I couldn't relax in bed and I always took Advil before going to bed. 

We recently moved cross-country, so we decided it was a good time to just ditch the old bed altogether. We spent the first 2 months after moving sleeping on our guest bed (spring mattress), which was better than the old one, but not great. We shopped around a lot before deciding on Casper - what really sold us was the non-chemical burn retardant and the fact that it is made in the U.S. Plus, we were reassured that it could be returned without a hassle if it didn't work out (even from Montana).

Lucky for us, the Casper has worked out even better than we could have even imagined! We've only had it for about 2 weeks, but I have already discovered that I do not need Advil to sleep. It is perfect: soft, but not too soft, and firm, but not too firm. Sam and I both love it (as do the cats).

I cannot exactly describe what laying down on the Casper feels like, but I think I can come pretty close:  

Imagine laying on a memory foam bed (or mattress topper), but just as you start to sink down, you're pulled up ever-so-slightly as if you had a ceiling-mounted tractor beam.  So you are laying on the bed but just hovering at its surface.  The bed certainly feels soft enough for you to sink in deeper, yet you somehow remain suspended atop it.

The mattress decompressed very quickly when removed from its packaging, and there was not even a trace of odor (i.e. off-gassing) from the mattress at any time.  

In terms of box springs, I did a bunch of research and ended up with the Simple Life folding foundation, which I'm very happy with.

I was previously waking up with sore shoulders and lower back pain. I really wanted to wake up the first morning after we got our Casper, magically pain free. I can't say that happened and I learned that the note they give on the instructions about needing a couple of weeks for your body to relearn how to properly sleep after a spring mattress was true. It took about 10 days, but there was a morning I awoke pain free and I've been pain free ever since.

7679,2014-08-23,Scott Walther,37.0,Pikeville, North Carolina,5,Best mattress I've owned in 20 years!!!,"Unboxing and setting up.  Both were very easy.  I had my old bed up and out of the room in no time and the Casper Sleep mattress out of the box, exterior and interior packaging in no time.

First impression.  Soft and springy.  Softer than I expected.  While you are laying there though you start to notice that it isn't as soft as you though but rather more supportive for your body and it's curves.  One of the things I hated on my last mattress was that it was hard.  My body didn't feel like it lined up right on it.  Felt more like sleeping on a thin mat on the floor.  We bought a 2.5 memory foam topper to put on top and that helped a bit but later I noticed two things.  First was that my back always felt like it would sink into the topper so I felt hunched over while in bed.  I would wake up with back pain because of it.  The second thing was that it maintained a lot of body heat.  Sometimes I would wake up sweating because of it.  The pad under me would feel red hot and I would have to change my shirt to go back to sleep.

The Casper Sleep mattress has a supportive feel to it right out of the box.  When I laid down on it for the first time I could feel my upper back and buttock sink in to the foam but my mid to lower back felt pushback from the latex foam keeping it from sinking in.  Not enough pushback to make it feel awkward or feel like someone is pushing your midsection up into the air but just enough to keep you comfortable.  

3 Months Later.   So far this is the best mattress Ive slept on or own in the last 20 years since moving out of mom and dads house.  It does take a little bit to adjust to it, especially sleeping on spring mattresses for 20 years.  My daughter has a cool gel memory foam mattress and ever since we bought it I thought that she had the most comfortable bed in the house.  Now it feels like a toss up.  I absolutely love getting a good nights sleep now.  I wish this had been available years ago.  We went through so many mattresses over the last 20 years it is insane how much we spent on them.  

Suggested changes.  My old mattress was 13 tall with a 2.5 foam topper.  All of this on a bed frame that was about 5 off the ground and a box spring.  So it sat up high.  With the Casper sleep on being 10 tall we lost a lot of height on our bed.  However, the sleep we get now is a lot more comfortable so it was a worthwhile trade off.  Maybe 2 more of the supportive foam at the bottom to compensate.

In my opinion, it is well worth the cost.  Give it a try since there is the 40-day return policy.  If you dont like it, just give them a call.  You will be reimbursed and can press on with another mattress.",8,Sleeps with a partner,1009,False,True,False,False,False

And it's been great! I experienced no issues unfurling my new queen-sized mattress, and my dog immediately fell asleep on it, before I'd even put on the sheets. At first I thought it was maybe a little too firmand there's still that possibility since I've primarily been sleeping on top of my comforter due to the summer heatbut I've had no issues so far.

7694,2014-08-07,Sean Hertzsch,39.0,Covington, Kentucky,5,Absolutely worth the wait,"I got this mattress a few weeks after they released and so my experience with the shipping is skewed and by no means do I think it reflects what your experience would be.
With that said, I can't address the shipping experience. 

When I got my box in the mail, I was so excited that I forgot to remove my old mattress. It was easy to pull out of the box and tearing through the plastic, it just unfolded itself and formed the proper shape. 

I have an IKEA Nyvoll frame with slats and no box spring. 

My first tests were simply to flop onto the mattress. This resulted in a comfortable fall and very little rebound. There was no noise from my bed frame. It was like I hadn't fallen at all. I then bounced a few times until my girlfriend flopped down beside me. I barely felt her (145lbs) hit the mattress either. 
As to the breathability, I have slept on this mattress in 80+ degree heat with no more sweating or heat conservation than my last mattress from Mattress Firm. Well, that isn't totally true. It may be a bit warmer, but no where near what my experience with other foam or latex mattresses have been.
This is truly one of the most comfortable mattresses I have ever slept on. It yields gently to your weight with time. I sleep on my side with my arm under my head and it doesn't affect my circulation as much as other mattresses have.
I won't get into details about other nocturnal activities, but rest assured that this mattress is great for that as well. There are no springs to bend, the corners offer excellent grip, and best of all it cleans easily. 

I can't rave enough about this mattress, or the company for that matter. As I alluded earlier, I had issues with delivery and the management, up to the CEO was involved in making sure I got my mattress as quickly as possible, without prompting. 

I hope this company really does disrupt the market. I have purchased 5 mattresses in my life from 5 different companies. I will go back to Casper when I need another one.

Mercifully, I think my second one was my last, but my back is seriously in need of rehabbing from all that time spent not functioning right. That means even though I am finally fixed up, I still have a long road ahead of me, and I still wake up in significant pain pretty often. Or, I should say, I used to.  I know a lot of reviews say it's hard to get out of bed with Casper, and that's a good thing. As someone with back problems, I'm actually celebrating it being *easier* for me to get out of bed, because it's rare that I wake up in pain, now. Casper has given me my mornings back. Not that I *want* to get out of it, of course ;)

I was a little concerned about how supportive it would be-- I need a really supportive mattress, and usually this has meant firm. It's perfectly supportive. Just the right amount of squish, just like the website says. And how could you not love a mattress company that actually acknowledges that people have sex on their beds? It's a secondary but very significant use case. Not a terribly romantic way of putting it I guess, but I'm glad Casper cares about ALL the things I do in bed. Which, by the way, also includes sitting and reading a book (... let's be real, playing games on my phone...) before bed. Which is also a very pleasant experience.

Casper recommends waiting at least 14 days before making any real decisions on the mattress...I completely agree and would even argue that 20-25 days is an even better wait. It's been 1 month since we started sleeping on the Casper and it definitely took me 3 weeks before I was fully comfortable. My wife said it was about 18 days for her. That's not to say it was uncomfortable for those 3 weeks - that's far from true. It was just a matter of adjusting to the differences and allowing my body to work out those kinks. I'm sure many people will notice instant improvement when sleeping on Casper the first night, but if you don't, please give it time. I think you'll be happy you did. 
The whole experience has been phenomenal, from using the chat function on the website to get some feedback before the purchase, to the quick shipping and easy unboxing, through the great sleep we're now getting on it. 
I've spent a lot of time thinking about this process and honestly can't believe there's a better way to do it.

All that changed when a friend sent me a link to a new mattress company called Casper.  It was exactly what I was looking for, a company that seemed to tap into my very needs.  My need to get a good nights sleep.  I've had my Casper about a week now, and just love it.  It gets more comfortable each night as my body adjusts to actual comfort.  I truly believe that everyone should try one.  I haven't looked forward to going to bed at home for years before Casper.  I've stayed in my fair share of five star hotels for someone of only 35 years of age, and Casper exceeds even the best of those hotels.  I'm definitely one that enjoys the best life has to offer, and I know I've found the best mattress in Casper.

The mattress itself was unlike any bed I had tried. I spent a couple months researching different mattress types and visiting mattress stores, and I couldn't find anything that I really liked.  I knew I wanted a memory foam mattress, but I had a hard time finding the right combination of foam and gel.

My friend introduced me to the Casper website and I was immediately intrigued by the mattress and of course, the price.  When I saw the 40 day trial, I said ""sure, let's try it out.""

Even though I waited a month for the a mattress to arrive, the simple buying experience and the helpful email communications from the owners convinced me to keep the mattress even before laying on it.  

The mattress turned out to be awesome, needless to say. I had never owned a memory foam mattress before, so the slight bounce that the Casper has feels familiar and natural.  I really like that it doesn't have that sinking feeling that most memory foam mattresses do. It really is the perfect balance of support and comfort.

Unboxing this bed was a breeze, and actually a lot of fun to watch. The inner little boy in me actually wanted to do it all over again! No harsh chemical smell at all. Bed has a wonderfully soft top layer but is extremely supportive when you are lying down and very firm. My wife was a huge skeptic of Casper because she is pregnant, but allowed me to try because of the return policy. After sleeping on it the first night, she was sold! Now she loves it. We had a tempurpedic in the past (not the most expensive one) and the Casper is so much softer on top but with an equal amount of support. I highly recommend it!

Only cons I can find is that it runs a bit hotter while you sleep than a typical mattress, but better than other memory foam mattresses. Additionally if you enjoy sitting on the side of your bed, the Casper design makes that tough, as the bed corners are not  very rigid.

Once the the friendly Casper box arrived at our doorstep, we immediately rushed it into the bedroom to open our present that lay inside.  We were greeted with a small note, instructions, our mattress wrapped in foam sheets, and one very useful safety blade.  Freeing the Casper from it's sheath allowed it to unfurl and transform in front of our eyes -- from compressed rectangular prism of foam into magical bed of restoration and comfort.

I won't lie, having gone from a spring mattress my whole life to a foam/latex one needed a little adjusting. Though to be fair, it didn't take long.  The first night on our Casper I didn't sleep so well, but ever since we have both slept like babies.  The mattress is firm and supportive, but certainly not hard; it is cushiony and comfortable.  Compared to some memory foam mattresses that felt like rocks or sinkholes we tried in stores, the Casper feels just right.  My girlfriend's recurrent back pain, ever-present when sleeping on a traditional spring mattress, has virtually disappeared and our cats love sleeping on the Casper (or, at the very least, with us; but for the purpose of this review we'll say it is for the Casper).

My wife and I agree... the unboxing was really cool. Another reviewer equated it to ""taking its first breath"" - pretty accurate. I have had problems with lower back pain over the past few years, and with our old Serta Pillow Top, I would wake up (more often than not) stiff and sore. It would take me a few minutes to get up and get moving. The main thing I noticed after the Casper was that when I woke up, I was able to get moving more easily. Not really much in the way of stiffness or soreness or cracking and popping joints. :) And I didn't even realize that my old wake-up-and-get-moving routine was ""normal"" until I woke up and *wasn't* stiff and sore. The quality of my sleep also seems better. I think I was tossing and turning more on our old mattress. Now I seem to fall asleep and stay asleep. We also really like that there's not a lot of motion transference. If I do roll over, it doesn't disturb my wife and vice versa. Our dog also enjoys our new mattress. She seems to think it's pretty cozy too. ;)

PROS
- Quality seems solid.
- Very comfortable.
- No springs means no creaks. Wife likes that a lot. The only creaks we get are from our box spring set that we have it resting on.
- No motion transference.
- No ""sink-in"" and ""can't get out."" You get in, and rest comfortably on a foamy surface.
- Easy to get in, get out of, and move around/roll over on the bed.
- Wife was tired of old pillow top mattress not holding sheets in place. Sheets fit this one perfectly and stay on.
- Wife likes that it is firm, comfortable, and lightweight compared to our bulky and very hard to move pillow top.
- Wife loved that there was no ""new mattress smell"" / no chemical smell or odors.

CONcernS
- Wife and I are concerned about long-term wear and divoting being a foam mattress. Time will tell.
- For us, there was an adjustment period of a couple days (as one might expect.) We went from a luxurious pillow top to a rather spartan no-frills mattress comparatively speaking. Wife misses pillow top, but likes the way this one sleeps. That being said - no regrets.
- For me, the mattress sleeps a little bit warm. My wife is more cold natured, and so she's more comfortable and cozy. This is something I'm getting used to though.
