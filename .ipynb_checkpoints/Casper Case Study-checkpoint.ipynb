    "The K-Means algorithm is an unsupervised learning technique used to create k clusters of mutually exclusive groups. Every observation is assigned to one and only one group. The scientist chooses the value of k, but does so with the aid of a scree plot (elbow graph) which shows the within-cluster variance for various values of k. The within-cluster variance decreases quickly at first, then levels off, creating an elbow. Often, it is at the elbow that we choose the value of k. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once k is chosen, the algorithm is performed. K centroids are randomly placed in the n-dimensional space of the dataset. Then, a distance measure is calculated between each observation and the k centroids. The observations are then assigned to the cluster of the closest centroid. The average of each cluster is then calculated and the centroids positions are reassigned (ie. they move). The process starts over and the distance between every observation and each newly-placed centroid is calculated. The data is reassigned to the closest centroid cluster and the averages of each cluster are calculated again. The process continues until the groups remain unchanged. \n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on where the centroids randomly initialize, different clusters can form (i.e. the clusters converge on different local minima). So the algorithm is run multiple times and the solution that yields the smallest aggregate within-cluster variance is chosen as having the best groups. \n",
